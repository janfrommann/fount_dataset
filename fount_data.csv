"Today, I believe that happiness is, it‚Äôs really a default state. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs there when you remove the sense that something is missing in your life. We are highly judgmental, survival, and replication machines. We are constantly walking around thinking I need this, I need that, trapped in the web of desires. Happiness is that state when nothing is missing. When nothing is missing, your mind shuts down and your mind stops running into the future or running into the past to regret something or to plan something. In that absence for a moment, you have internal silence. When you have internal silence, then you are content and you are happy.

The more present I am, the happier and more content I will be. If I latch onto that, if I say, ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm happy now‚Äù, and I want to stay happy, then I‚Äôm going to drop out of that happiness.

Second law of thermodynamics says that entropy only goes up, which means disorder in the universe only goes up, which means concentrated free energy only goes down. If you look at what living things are, living systems, humans, plants, civilizations, what have you, these are systems that are locally reversing entropy. Humans locally reverse entropy because we have action. In the process, we globally accelerate entropy until the heat death of the universe. You could come up with some fanciful theory, which I like, that we‚Äôre headed towards the heat death of the universe, where there‚Äôs no concentrated energy, where everything is sort of at the same energy level.

The narrower the initial focus, the more likely one is¬†to build a deeper and differentiated product.

Narrower market ‚Üí deeper end user empathy for founders & product teams.¬†Conversely, too much breadth can introduce noise in early user research & product work.¬†

Overall, starting narrow improves one's likelihood to discover & solve a precise pain point.‚Äù",https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/wedge

"‚ÄúWedge selection should be very intentional. Don‚Äôt just build for the first customer persona you think of or the closest city to where you live. Build for the group that has the most acute pain point, or the highest willingness to pay, or the fastest sales cycles. The more carefully you pick your wedge, the easier it will be to succeed and to expand to the larger market. A product that‚Äôs 10x better on average might actually be 50x better for some groups but only 1.1x better for others. Picking the right group will determine whether you quickly find¬†product-market fit or face an uphill battle.‚Äù

"What makes a good wedge?
From what I could tell, a good wedge:

Is narrow and focused‚Äîsolves a very specific problem, for a specific group, extremely well

Builds momentum‚Äîcan be sold quickly and keeps customers coming back

Naturally extends into a much bigger opportunity‚Äîmore product, more revenue, more users

Avoids competition‚Äîthe whole point is to give you an easier path

Is hard to replicate‚Äîit is not just about getting in, but also staying in

Educates the market‚Äîsometimes customers aren‚Äôt ready for the bigger transformation, and need to start with a small dose",https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/wedge

"Perhaps some startups have no plan and really are just building features, likely with the hope of flipping themselves to larger companies. Good startups, however, think about the whole wedge from the start. They build an initial user base with simple features and then quickly iterate to create products that are enduringly useful, thereby creating companies that have stand-alone, defensible value.",https://cdixon.org/2010/12/26/the-thin-edge-of-the-wedge-strategy
A huge challenge for user-generated websites is overcoming the chicken-and-egg problem: attracting users and contributors when you are starting with zero content.¬†One way to approach this challenge is to use what Geoffrey Moore calls the¬†bowling pin strategy:¬†find a niche where the chicken-and-egg problem is more easily overcome and then find ways to hop from that niche to other niches and eventually to the broader market.,https://cdixon.org/2010/08/21/the-bowling-pin-strategy
"How do you identify a good initial niche? ¬†First, it has to be a true community ‚Äì people who have shared interests and frequently interact with one another. ¬†They should also have a particularly strong need for your product to be willing to put up with an initial lack of content.

"1.¬†Signal long-term commitment to platform success and competitive pricing. ¬† When Microsoft launched the original Xbox, ¬†they made a big deal of publicly committing to spending $500M promoting the platform, thereby signalling that they were fully committed for the long haul and giving comfort to 3rd party game developers. ¬† Another way to give comfort that your platform isn‚Äôt going away is to open source it ‚Äì this way third parties know that even if the company stops supporting the product, independent developers can continue to do so (e.g. Google Android and Chrome). ¬†Open sourcing also gives comfort that the company isn‚Äôt going to raise prices once they‚Äôve reached critical mass.",https://cdixon.org/2009/08/25/six-strategies-for-overcoming-chicken-and-egg-problems
"3.¬†Exploit irregular network topologies. In the last 90s, most people assumed that dating websites was a ‚Äúwinner take all market‚Äù and Match.com had won it, until a swath of niche competitors arose (e.g. Jdate) that succeeded because certain groups of people tend to date others from that same group. ¬†Real-life networks are often very different from the idealized, uniformly distributed networks pictured in economics textbooks. ¬†Facebook exploited the fact that social connections are highly clustered at colleges as a ‚Äúbeachhead‚Äù to challenge much bigger incumbents (Friendster). ¬†By finding clusters in the network smaller companies can reach critical mass within those sub-clusters and then expand beyond.",https://cdixon.org/2009/08/25/six-strategies-for-overcoming-chicken-and-egg-problems

"Online storage products usually divide things by the amount of storage. The nice thing about this is 1) you can test a bunch of different prices/storage levels, 2) you get to have a free version plus multiple tiers of paid, which means your pricing can more granularly track customers‚Äô willingness-to-pay. The goal of all revenue maximizing pricing structures is to minimize what economists call ‚Äúconsumer surplus.‚Äù Since you can‚Äôt gaze into the mind of the user to see what she is willing to pay, and attempts at explicit price discrimination are usually met with outrage, you have to look for proxies for willingness-to-pay. ",https://cdixon.org/2009/09/04/dividing-free-and-paid-features-in-freemium-products
"A final thought: ¬†when in doubt, err on the side of putting more features on the paid side of the divide. ¬† It‚Äôs easy to add features to the free side; ¬†however, removing features from the free side is a recipe for trouble.",https://cdixon.org/2009/09/04/dividing-free-and-paid-features-in-freemium-products
"Products with so-called networks effects get more valuable when more people use them. ¬†Famous examples are telephones and social networks.

‚ÄúComplementary network effects‚Äù refer to situations where a product gets more valuable as more people use the product‚Äôs complement(s). Two products are complementary when they are more (or only) useful together ‚Äì for example, a video game and video game console, or an OS and an application for that OS. ¬†Microsoft Windows gets more valuable the more apps are made for it, which in turn makes Windows more popular, which in turn leads to more apps, and so on. ¬†Microsoft Windows is not more valuable simply because there are more copies of Microsoft Windows in the world, but because there are more complements to Windows in the world",https://cdixon.org/2009/08/25/six-strategies-for-overcoming-chicken-and-egg-problems
"2.¬†Use backwards and sideways compatibility to benefit from existing complements. Microsoft of course has used backward compatibility very successfully for decades with DOS and then Windows, as have many game console makers. ¬†In our paper we argue that the successful early bill pay (‚Äúbill presentment‚Äù) companies provided backward compatibility by sending snail mail checks to merchants who had yet to sign on to their electronic platform.

Virtual machines and Bootcamp gave Apple‚Äôs hardware some sideways compatibility with Windows. ¬†Sun‚Äôs invention of Java could be seen as an attempt to introduce sideways compatibility between its shrinking server market and its competitors (Windows, Linux) by introducing a new, cross-platform programming layer.

"4. Influence the firms that produce vital complements. ¬†Sony and Philips, the companies that oversaw the successful launch of the compact disc technology in the early 1980‚Ä≤s, followed the CD launch with the introduction of the digital audiotape (DAT) in 1987. The DAT offered CD sound quality and, in a significant improvement over CD technology, it also offered the ability to record music.¬†¬†Despite these improvements, the DAT never gained significant consumer adoption and ended as an embarrassing failure for Sony and Philips. ¬†DAT failed because Sony and Philips failed to reassure record companies who were concerned that the recording capabilities of DAT would lead to widespread piracy. ¬†Sony finally reached an anti-piracy agreement with record companies in 1992, but by that time consumer expectations for the DAT platform were dampened sufficiently to doom the platform.",https://cdixon.org/2009/08/25/six-strategies-for-overcoming-chicken-and-egg-problems
5. Provide standalone value for the base product,https://cdixon.org/2009/08/25/six-strategies-for-overcoming-chicken-and-egg-problems

"6.¬†Integrate vertically into critical complements when supply is not certain. ¬†To overcome the chicken and egg problem, companies must find a way to ensure an adequate supply, variety, and quality of complementary goods. By vertically integrating into the complement product as well as the base product, a company can attempt to ensure an adequate supply of both goods. ¬†Nintendo is the leading developer of games for its consoles, and Microsoft and Sony fund many of their most popular games.

Vertical integration is risky ‚Äì as witnessed by the Apple computer in the late 80s and early 90s. By remaining tightly integrated, Apple precluded market competition from providing the necessary variety of price-competitive complements and base products.",https://cdixon.org/2009/08/25/six-strategies-for-overcoming-chicken-and-egg-problems

"The brain also doesn‚Äôt store information neurally and objectively. We reinvent and rewrite our memory every time we try to retrieve information. The brain works with rules of thumb and makes things look as if they fit, even if they don‚Äôt. It remembers events that never happened, connects unrelated episodes to convincing narratives and completes incomplete images. It cannot help but see patterns and meaning everywhere, even in the most random things (cf. Byrne, 2008). The brain, as Kahneman writes, is ‚Äúa machine for jumping to conclusions‚Äù (Kahneman, 2013, 79).",

"In Christianity the idea of total acceptance is somewhat hidden; it is only spoken of directly in some of the writings of the mystics, but it is soon discovered when we begin to make a thorough search into the symbolism of Christian doctrine. In the religions of the East, however, it is given particular emphasis; in fact, it is the fundamental principle of Vedantist, Buddhist, and Taoist philosophy. The chief difference between these Eastern religions and Christianity is that, on the surface at least, Christianity is concerned with belief in doctrines whereas the Eastern religions are concerned with states of mind. That is to say, Christianity tends to be a theological and ethical religion, while Buddhism, Taoism, and Vedanta are psychological religions.",

This is not all, for not only has it little to do with such essentials; it is also a decided hindrance to spiritual growth because it encourages a ‚Äúlove‚Äù of God on a false basis.

"Robert and Elizabeth Ligon Bjork from the University of California suggest distinguishing between two different measurements when it comes to memory: Storage strength and retrieval strength (Bjork 2011). They speculate that storage strength, the ability to store memories, only becomes greater over one‚Äôs lifetime. We add more and more information to our long-term memory. Just by looking at the physical capacity of our brains, we can see that we could indeed probably store a lifetime and a bit of detailed experiences in",
"The science of learning is still undecided on the question of whether we all share Shereshevsky‚Äôs ability to memorise virtually everything we ever have encountered, but are only better at suppressing it. After all, sometimes we suddenly remember scenes from the past in great detail, triggered by a cue like the scent of a madeleine in Proust‚Äôs recherche. These moments of involuntary memory might be like small cracks in the mental barrier through which we can catch a glimpse of all the memories we have collected over our lifetimes, but might never again have access to. Forgetting, then, would not be the loss of a memory, but the erection of a mental barrier between the conscious mind and our long-term memory. Psychologists call this mechanism active inhibition (cf. MacLeod, 2007). It is easy to understand what it is good for: Without a very thorough filter, our brains would constantly be flooded by memories, making it impossible to focus on anything in our surroundings.",

First, you basically fix your present understanding, as the outcome instead of using it as the starting point, priming yourself for one-sided perception. Then you artificially create a conflict of interest between getting things done (finding support for your preconceived argument) and generating insight, turning any departure from your preconceived plan into a mutiny against the success of your own project.

"While the constant comparison of notes can help us to detect differences, no technique can help us see what is missing.

One of the most famous figures to illustrate this skill is the mathematician Abraham Wald (Mangel and Samaniego 1984). During World War II, he was asked to help the Royal Air Force find the areas on their planes that were most often hit by bullets so they could cover them with more armour. But instead of counting the bullet holes on the returned planes, he recommended armouring the spots where none of the planes had taken any hits.

"The fact that too much order can impede learning has become more and more known (Carey 2014). Conversely, we know that the deliberate creation of variations and contrasts can facilitate learning. Nate Kornell and Bjork showed this when they experimentally taught students different art styles. First, they used the traditional approach of showing students one art style at a time using different paintings. Then, they deliberately mixed up the styles and shuffled the paintings around. The students who were presented paintings from different styles in no particular order learned to distinguish styles faster and were also much more successful at matching paintings to styles and artists they had never seen before.",

Experienced academic readers usually read a text with questions in mind and try to relate it to other possible approaches, while inexperienced readers tend to adopt the question of a text and the frames of the argument and take it as a given. What good readers can do is spot the limitations of a particular approach and see what is not mentioned in the text.",

"Learning requires effort, because we have to think to understand and we need to actively retrieve old knowledge to convince our brains to connect it with new ideas as cues. To understand how groundbreaking this idea is, it helps to remember how much effort teachers still put into the attempt to make learning easier for their students by prearranging information, sorting it into modules, categories and themes. By doing that, they achieve the opposite of what they intend to do.

"In a small but fascinating study, two psychologists tried to find out if it made a difference if students in a lecture took notes by hand or by typing them into their laptops (Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014). They were not able to find any difference in terms of the number of facts the students were able to remember. But in terms of understanding the content of the lecture, the students who took their notes by hand came out much, much better. After a week, this difference in understanding was still clearly measurable. There is no secret to it and the explanation is pretty simple: Handwriting is slower and can‚Äôt be corrected as quickly as electronic notes. Because students can‚Äôt write fast enough to keep up with everything that is said in a lecture, they are forced to focus on the gist of what is being said, not the details. But to be able to note down the gist of a lecture, you have to understand it in the first place.",

"Of course, gap stories can reflect reality. In apartheid South Africa, black people and white people lived on different income levels and there was a true gap between them, with almost no overlap. The gap story of separate groups was absolutely relevant. But apartheid was very unusual. Much more often, gap stories are a misleading overdramatization. In most cases there is no clear separation of two groups, even if it seems like that from the averages. We almost always get a more accurate picture by digging a little deeper and looking not just at the averages but at the spread: not just the group all bundled together, but the individuals. Then we often see that apparently distinct groups are in fact very much overlapping.",

Blood chills as it passes through the cold arms, hands, and feet, and when it eventually circulates back to the heart it lowers the body‚Äôs overall core temperature. In extreme cases, afterdrop can be fatal. An hour elapses before I feel ready to get back on my feet for the climb down the mountain. No longer focused enough to let my body resist the elements, I don the black pea-coat that I brought up in a backpack.",
"This vast and complex network of vessels would extend more than 60,000 miles if laid end to end. In a single day, the 5.6 liters of blood in a human body travels a total of almost 12,000 miles through the system, or almost four times the distance across the United States.",

"Once you‚Äôre already cold, clench the muscles in your feet and hands and then sequentially tighten every muscle above them. The method is essentially the same as the one you use during power breathing except that now, rather than simply pushing all the blood up to your head in general, you instead focus on a specific point on a small ridge on the backside of your skull where the temporal bone and occipital bone meet just behind your ears.",
"The brain burns far more energy than any other part of the body. In a typical day an adult male burns 2,200 calories, but the brain gobbles up 15 to 20 percent of that energy. To put this into context: If you charge up all 1,576 stairs from the ground floor to the observation deck of the Empire State Building, your muscles will burn only 54 calories, which is roughly the equivalent of a single Oreo cookie. (This is not to say that going up all those flights of stairs won‚Äôt burn calories, but most of the additional energy actually stems from increased circulation and heart rate.) If you can turn down even a few of the brain‚Äôs higher functions, you will see a vast improvement in your ability to hold your breath. And there is no better tool to dissect and modulate the inner workings of the mind than meditation.",
"Brown fat is a fundamental tissue in mammals that, at the time, was mostly understood as something that rodents used to help heat themselves during hibernation.

Consciousness is ‚Äúinexplicable on mechanical principles, i.e., by shapes and movements,‚Äù Leibniz wrote. ‚ÄúIf we imagine a machine whose structure makes it think, sense, and be conscious, we can conceive of it being enlarged in such a way that we can go inside it like a mill.

"While you‚Äôre in this moment of shock and pain, you have two basic goals. First, you need to control your breathing and keep calm. The sensations that most closely match the feeling of burning will dissipate if you focus your mind on the pain. Try to relax instead of tightly clenching up every muscle. Enduring the snow is the same exact mental trick as trying to delay a sneeze or resist being ticklish.",
"Your body will quickly deplete the oxygen stores available in the lungs and have to rely solely on what is available in the bloodstream. When you get close to needing to gasp, you can extend your limits in two ways. The first is the same as with basic breathing, slowly letting out what is left of the air in your lungs. The second method will become critical later for controlling vasoconstriction. It consists of a rolling set of muscle contractions that you start at your feet and sequentially tighten until you reach up to your head.",
"different breathing routines target different aspects of the nervous system. The basic breathing technique of holding your breath after hyperventilating acts mostly on parasympathetic nerves. The sympathetic system only starts to kick in closer to the moment when you are struggling to stop yourself from gasping, and it is often best to train with breath-out holds. Breath-in holds are better for getting to your absolute maximum number of pushups or retention duration, but are less efficient at cracking into your nervous system.",

Any one of us can decide to take a breath or blink our eyes, but if we let our minds wander, some deep part of our nervous system takes over.

"Harris concludes: ‚ÄúHowever, such puzzles merely suggest that certain moral questions could be difficult or impossible to answer in practice; they do not suggest that morality depends upon something other than the consequences of our actions and intentions.

"Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, and 100%)",
Negative leverage: The ability to make your counterpart suffer. You can threaten him to take something away he currently owns (strong due to loss aversion),
Active listening goes beyond just the words. The 7-38-55 rule states that only 7 percent of a message is communicated verbally. 38 percent is based on the voice and 55 percent on the body language of your counterpart. Look for incongruence between the three components to spot lies or unresolved problems.,
Assertives believe time is money. All they care about is winning. They have an aggressive and direct communication style.,

The paper revolves around the concept of WEIRD, which stands for Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. The problem is that WEIRD people are, well, odd. Along various dimensions, they sit at the extremes relative to people raised in all other types of societies.

You must really have invested a lot in it.‚Äù ‚ÄúSure we have a lot of competitors, so you‚Äôre in good shape in that regard. Now when do you need to get your line back up and running?‚Äù",
"Step One: The Main Exercise Like the main exercise of attention practice, insight meditation can be broken down into three stages. The first involves looking at a thought or emotion with ordinary awareness‚Äîsimply identifying thoughts or feelings without any specific purpose or intention.",
"Begin by ‚Äútaming your horse.‚Äù If you‚Äôre practicing formally, assume the seven-point posture to the best of your ability. Otherwise, just straighten your spine while keeping the rest of your body relaxed and balanced. ‚ÄúTame the rider‚Äù by allowing your mind simply to relax in a state of objectless attention. After a few moments, perform a quick ‚Äúscanning exercise.‚Äù This time, however, instead of focusing on the sensations themselves, gently allow yourself to recognize that you have a body, as well as a mind that‚Äôs capable of scanning it. Allow yourself to recognize how wonderful these very basic facts of your existence really are and how precious it is to have a body and a mind capable of being aware of the body. Appreciating these gifts plants the seeds for happiness and relief from suffering. There is such relief in simply knowing you‚Äôre alive and aware.",
"Another approach is to rest your attention lightly on whomever or whatever you‚Äôve chosen while asking yourself, ‚ÄúHow much do I want to be happy? How much do I want to avoid pain or suffering?‚Äù Let your thoughts on these points be as specific as possible. For example, if you‚Äôre stuck somewhere very hot, would you rather move to a cooler and more open place? If you feel some sort of physical pain, would you like the pain to be lifted? As you think about your own answers, gradually turn your attention to the object you‚Äôve chosen and imagine how he or she would feel in the same situation.",
"your underlying motivation is to get rid of the pain, you‚Äôre actually reinforcing the mental and emotional habits associated with hope and fear. The best way to relinquish fixation on these habits is to simply make the effort to observe the pain objectively, leaving results to sort themselves out.",
"The ideal approach lies between these two extremes. Hmm, there‚Äôs a thought. There‚Äôs a feeling. There‚Äôs a sensation. Oh, now it‚Äôs gone. Oh, now it‚Äôs back. Oh, now it‚Äôs gone again. Now it‚Äôs back. We can treat these appearances and disappearances like a game, the way children sometimes look at clouds: ‚ÄúWhat do you see?‚Äù a child may exclaim. ‚ÄúI see a dragon!‚Äù one might respond.",
"When he told Tai Situ Rinpoche about his solution, Rinpoche told him there was no benefit in that. ‚ÄúI‚Äù wasn‚Äôt the problem. To recognize emptiness you have to look at the roots of ‚ÄúI‚Äù‚Äîignorance, desire, and so on.",
"When we look at risks in Extremistan, we don‚Äôt look at evidence (evidence comes too late), we look at potential damage: never has the world been more prone to more damage; never.6 It is hard to explain to naive data-driven people that risk is in the future, not in the past.",
"The third could be translated in a variety of ways: ‚Äúseeing the untrue as true,‚Äù ‚Äúholding what is inauthentic as authentic,‚Äù or, more loosely, ‚Äúseeing the unreal as real.‚Äù Basically, all these terms signify an adherence to the belief that the qualities we see in ourselves, others, or conditions are truly, permanently, or inherently existing. In Buddhist terms, this tendency would be known as eternalism‚Äîa tendency to hold certain aspects of experience as absolute and enduring rather than as a combination of temporary combinations of causes and conditions.",
"As discussed earlier, our physiological constitution‚Äîthe relationship between our sense organs, the various structures in our brain, and the automatic responses of other physical systems‚Äîpredisposes us toward organizing our experiences in terms of distinctions. Our cultural and familial backgrounds, as well as the events that occur in our individual lives, meanwhile, nurture and enhance this biological predisposition. Gradually, a kind of cyclical relationship evolves. As perception influences experience, experience influences behavior; behavior reinforces experience, and experience reinforces perception. Layer upon layer of mud accumulates.",
"But there‚Äôs a third level of experience which I call ‚Äúfake relative reality.‚Äù In it, ideas, feelings, and perceptions are intimately bound up in our perception of ourselves, other people, sensations, and situations. Fake relative reality is the main source of self-created suffering. It emerges from attachment to ideas, feelings, and perceptions about ourselves and others as essential characteristics.",
It is more akin to what neuroscientists describe as the capacity to organize the information received through the senses and form a concept or mental image.,
"Right here, right now there is only the present ‚ÄúAhh.‚Äù",
"Relative wisdom, acknowledging limited and limiting beliefs and behaviors, is only part of the path of cessation: what you might call the ‚Äúpreparation stage.‚Äù In order to actually cut through our self-imposed limitations, we need to spend a little time observing our mental and emotional habits, befriending them, and perhaps discovering within our most challenging experiences a powerful company of bodyguards.",
"The ‚Äúpositive prognosis‚Äù of the Third Noble Truth is that the limited or limiting ideas we hold about ourselves, others, and every other experience can be unlearned.",
"We accomplish this not by suppressing our desires, our aversions, our fixations, or trying to ‚Äúthink differently,‚Äù but rather by turning our awareness inward, examining the thoughts, emotions, and sensations that trouble us, and beginning to notice them‚Äîand perhaps even appreciate them‚Äîas expressions of awareness itself. Simply put, the cause of the various diseases we experience is the cure. The mind that grasps is the mind that sets us free.",

Yet among many of the people I‚Äôve met in Western cultures these same physical characteristics are often considered signs of ill health.",
"On a purely literal level, the first Buddha Nature Blocker is known as ‚Äúfaintheartedness‚Äù or ‚Äútimidity.‚Äù On a deeper level, the term points to a deeply ingrained tendency to judge or to criticize ourselves, exaggerating what we may perceive as defects in thought, feeling, character, or behavior.

"The best way to work with thoughts is to step back and rest your mind in objectless shinay for a minute and then bring your attention to each thought and the ideas that revolve around it. Observe both directly for a few minutes, just as you would observe the shape or color of a form. Then rest in the simple awareness of bare attention, alternating between attention to thoughts and the broader field of objectless attention.",
"The points are simple: Keep your spine straight and your muscles loose. Like the seven-point posture, the two-point version fosters a balance between relaxation and alertness, neither too loose nor too tight, but somewhere in between.",
"In other words, to use the mind to look at the mind. That‚Äôs a basic definition of what, in the Buddhist tradition, is commonly referred to as ‚Äúmeditation.‚Äù",

"As a young student at Sherab Ling, I was taught to look out for three such ‚Äúbumps‚Äù in particular: permanence, singularity, and independence.",
"It‚Äôs tough to let go of expectations, not to assume, to listen instead of talking, to take copious notes all the time, to be certain not to spill beans. But with training and practice, blank slate can become a behavioral goal and discipline for anyone.",
"As we take notes, we are also allowing the adversary to be more okay, by making her feel more important because we are taking notes on what she has to say.",
"The well-trained car salesman puts a slight damper on his customer‚Äôs excitement over the black car by saying, ‚ÄúBlack is a powerful color for a sports car, but it sure shows the dirt. It‚Äôll take work.‚Äù This brings the positive adversary closer to neutral and at the same time urges him to validate his own enthusiasm for the color black‚Äîhis vision of the color black.",
"Just as important, this open-ended question does not have a quick answer. It cannot be answered with yes, no, or maybe. The necessarily more extended answer will have‚Äîwell, may have‚Äîsome information, or some emotion, or some telltale waffling, or some insight. It should have something you can work with, because, as we know, people have a weakness for talking.",
"Nor did the point escape Machiavelli. Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote, citing him: ‚ÄúIt seemed, wrote Machiavelli, that in the midst of murders and civil wars, our republic became stronger [and] its citizens infused with virtues.‚Ä¶ A little bit of agitation gives resources to souls and what makes the species prosper isn‚Äôt peace, but freedom.‚Äù",
"As we‚Äôve seen earlier, there‚Äôs no way we can experience complete happiness and an end to suffering for ourselves without direct experience of our own and others‚Äô desire for happiness and release from suffering. Working toward our own release is like pulling the needle only out of one cheek. As long as a needle remains in our other cheek, we‚Äôll always feel a bit of discomfort, pain, or fear.",
"The moral of the story is to let go of the search for reasons and stories, and simply look at experience directly.",
"Whatever object you choose to look at‚Äîa rose, a TV screen, or the person ahead of you in the grocery store checkout line‚Äîyou‚Äôll probably notice that it has two aspects: shape and color. Focus on whichever aspect you prefer. The focus itself doesn‚Äôt matter: some people are more drawn to shapes, and others to colors. The idea is simply to rest your attention on either its color or its shape, engaging awareness only to the point of barely recognizing shape or color.",
"Most of us, when we look at something, hear something, or watch a thought or emotion, have some sort of judgment about the experience. This judgment can be understood in terms of three basic ‚Äúbranches‚Äù: the ‚ÄúI like it‚Äù branch, the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it‚Äù branch, or the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù branch.",
"Emptiness, the main subject of the Second Turning of the Wheel of Dharma, is probably one of the most confusing terms in Buddhist philosophy. Even long-term students of Buddhism have a hard time understanding it. Maybe that‚Äôs why the Buddha waited sixteen years after turning the First Wheel of Dharma to start talking about",
"Wisdom, capability, loving-kindness, and compassion are what we‚Äôre born with. Frustration, jealousy, guilt, shame, anxiety, greed, competitiveness, and so on, are experiences we learn, often through the influences of our culture, our families, and our friends, and reinforced by personal experience.",
"As I stated earlier, adhering to your mission and purpose will keep you from going seriously astray in a negative direction. Now you have a tool for keeping you oriented in a positive direction: your vision of your adversary‚Äôs pain. With both mission and purpose and pain you‚Äôre in great shape, but without both you‚Äôre wandering in the desert.",

"And now I add, no interrogative-led questions, no vision, no decision.",
"With only one worthwhile answer out of the three, it follows that verb-led questions are often a waste of time. Therefore there are only two reasons to ask such a question: if you already know the answer (law students are taught just this rule), or if you‚Äôre near the very end of the negotiation and you have to really bore in.",

"The initial stage is commonly referred to as ordinary lovingkindness/compassion, which begins with developing a sense of loving-kindness and compassion toward oneself and extending it toward those we know. The second stage is often known as immeasurable loving-kindness/compassion, an extension of the aspiration for happiness and release from suffering toward those we don‚Äôt know. The third stage is known as bodhicitta, the mind that is awake to the suffering of all sentient beings and spontaneously works to relieve that suffering.",

"First, depending on your circumstances, assume whatever physical posture is most convenient or comfortable. Next, allow your mind to rest for a moment in objectless attention. Just observe all the thoughts, sensations, and so on, that come up. Then choose something to look at‚Äîthe color of someone‚Äôs hair, the shape of his or her haircut, or a rose, a peach, or your desktop‚Äîand just rest your attention on it, noticing its shape or color. You don‚Äôt have to stare and if you need to blink, just blink. (In fact, if you don‚Äôt blink, your eyes will probably become irritated and whatever you‚Äôre looking at may appear irritating.) After a few moments of looking at someone or something, let your mind simply relax again in objectless attention.

In his original writings, Freud referred to this collection of functions as the ‚ÄúI,‚Äù a coherent sense of self that emerges from this delicate balancing act.

This instinct can impel us into these three common negotiating errors, which I have derived from what every attorney tells his client before a deposition or testimony: never answer an unasked question; don‚Äôt interpret a statement as a question; and never reply to random statements. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like what I see, Jim.‚Äù When we hear this, many of us will feel an urge to reply in some way, to try to set things right. ‚ÄúWell, Damon, this isn‚Äôt written in concrete.‚Äù No! The best way to deal with the leading unasked question or the provocative remark is to use it as a basis for prying out more information. How? By employing what I call a connector. To respond is average negotiating behavior; to connect is contrarian negotiating behavior, and much more effective.",

"In other words, we‚Äôre not really seeing the rose itself, but rather a concept of it.

In fact, according to neuroscientists I‚Äôve spoken with, the high we feel simply from the anticipation of getting what we want is linked to the production of dopamine, a chemical in the brain that generates, among other things, sensations of pleasure. Over time, our brains and our bodies are motivated to repeat the activities that stimulate the production of dopamine. We literally get hooked on anticipation.",

"We don‚Äôt have much choice in terms of our susceptibility to the experiences over which we have no control. But there is another category of pain, discomfort, dukkha, or whatever you want to call it: a virtually infinite variety of psychological tributaries that our minds spin around the people, events, and situations we encounter. My father and other teachers helped me to think of this type of pain as ‚Äúself-created‚Äù: experiences that evolve from our interpretation of situations and events, such as impulsive anger or lingering resentment aroused by others who behave in ways we don‚Äôt like, jealousy toward people who have more than we do, and paralyzing anxiety that occurs when there‚Äôs no reason to be afraid. Self-created suffering can take the form of the stories we tell ourselves, often deeply embedded in our unconsciousness, about not being good enough, rich enough, attractive enough, or secure in other ways.",
"Tibetan Buddhist texts liken this type of addictive behavior to ‚Äúlicking honey off a razor.‚Äù The initial sensation may be sweet, but the underlying effect is quite damaging.

"For the most part, these processes occur spontaneously, beyond the range of ordinary consciousness.

"No vision, no real decision: this is a rule of human nature.",
The mission and purpose must always be written.,

Therefore we pull our punches and say ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù or even ‚Äúyes‚Äù and believe that this solves everyone‚Äôs problem. We haven‚Äôt had to say the nasty word and our adversary hasn‚Äôt had to hear it. Win-win! No. Lose-lose, because we‚Äôre stuck in our emotions and then get victimized by our emotions.",
"You or your company may well have many M&Ps, because you have one for almost every major task you undertake, and for many seemingly minor tasks as well. You have the overall mission and purpose for your business or enterprise. You have a second mission and purpose for your negotiation with a specific adversary. Within that negotiation you have yet other layers of mission and purpose, each of which guides the decision making at that point. In complicated, high-stakes negotiations, my clients may have a written mission and purpose for almost every phone call to anyone on the other side. No kidding. And each, of course, is set in the world of the adversary.",

"This explanation of the Suffering of Change is close, but it misses the point. The dissatisfaction or disenchantment experienced when the novelty wears off or the situation starts to fall apart is actually the Suffering of Suffering. The Suffering of Change stems, more accurately, from the attachment to the pleasure derived from getting what we want: be it a relationship, a job, a good grade on an exam, or a shiny new car.",

When we are with people we think we are ahead of, or at least equal to, we feel comfortable. Conversation comes easily and questions seem to have no risk. We feel okay. But in the presence of people to whom we feel inferior, whether culturally, socially, or intellectually, we feel unokay and can become defensive, or aggressive, or resentful, or a lot of other emotions.",
"Fear of rejection is a sign of neediness‚Äîspecifically, the need to be liked. It is imperative for the negotiator to understand just what rejection is, and who can reject you and who cannot. Here‚Äôs the key point: Your adversaries in a negotiation cannot reject you. There‚Äôs nothing you need from them, so how can they reject you? It‚Äôs impossible.",
"Remember, new companies aren‚Äôt the only parties who can be needy. Some start-ups are well funded and choosy regarding any venture capitalist they may bring in.

I‚Äôm not quite sure that we as a venture fund fit where you‚Äôre going. I just don‚Äôt know.

"Very simply put, everything in our experience is always changing. The world around us, our bodies, our thoughts and feelings‚Äîeven our thoughts about our thoughts and feelings‚Äîare in constant flux, a progressive and ceaseless interplay of causes and conditions that create certain effects, which themselves become the causes and conditions that give rise to still other effects. In Buddhist terms, this constant change is known as impermanence. In many of his teachings the Buddha compared this movement to the tiny changes that occur in the flow of a river.",
"Simply acknowledging the fact that, at any given moment, we may face some type of uneasy or uncomfortable experience constitutes the essential lesson of the First Noble Truth.",
"My father‚Äôs advice to me, when I told him of the trouble I was having practicing meditation, offered a middle way between these two extremes. Instead of trying to block distractions or give in to them, I could welcome them as friends: ‚ÄúHello, fear! Hello, itch! How are you? Why don‚Äôt you stick around awhile so we can get to know each other?‚Äù",
"The disadvantage of this arrangement, however, lies in the fact that we end up mistaking a very small fraction of our moment-by-moment experience for the whole. This can cause problems when we‚Äôre faced with an uncomfortable situation or a strong emotion.",

"Birth, however, is considered an aspect of suffering for a couple of reasons. First of all, the transition from the protected environment of the womb (or an egg) into the wider world of sensory experience is considered‚Äînot only by Buddhist philosophers, but by many experts in the psychological, scientific, and health care fields‚Äîas something of a traumatic shift in experience. Many of us don‚Äôt consciously recall the drama of this initial transition, but the experience of expulsion from an enclosed, protective environment apparently leaves a dramatic impression on the brain and body of a newborn.",
"This is, perhaps, the essential message of the First Noble Truth: Life has a way of interrupting, presenting even the most contented among us with momentous surprises. Such surprises‚Äîalong with subtler, less noticeable experiences like the aches and pains that come with age, the frustration of waiting in line at the grocery store, or simply running late for an appointment‚Äîcan all be understood as manifestations of suffering.",

"If I were a beginner in the study of decision-based negotiation (as opposed to emotion- and compromise-based negotiation), my initial goals would be to focus at all times on my mission and purpose, to control my neediness and never demonstrate neediness, to always allow my adversary to be okay, to have no fear of saying or hearing ‚Äúno‚Äù‚Äîthe subjects of the preceding chapters.",

It doesn‚Äôt bother you that you weigh only x or y pounds and not three hundred. Why should it bother you that you have only x or y years to live and not more? You accept the limits placed on your body. Accept those placed on your time.,
"The serious negotiator understands that he or she cannot go out into the world spending emotional energy in the effort to be liked, to be smart, to be important. This negotiator wants to be recognized as being effective and businesslike, that‚Äôs all. She spends her energy on the task of business.",
"In spite of what is studied in business schools concerning ‚Äúeconomies of scale,‚Äù size hurts you at times of stress; it is not a good idea to be large during difficult times.",
"Buddhism offers a third option. We can look directly at the disturbing emotions and other problems we experience in our lives as stepping-stones to freedom. Instead of rejecting them or surrendering to them, we can befriend them, working through them to reach an enduring, authentic experience of our inherent wisdom, confidence, clarity, and joy.",
"Now let‚Äôs recall that negotiation from earlier in this chapter, the one in which the adversary wants the same volume discount for three thousand widgets that our company usually gives for much larger orders. Mentioning the number thirty-three thousand early in the negotiation was intended to drive up my client‚Äôs positive expectations, and against many negotiators this time-tested trick might have worked. But my team had done its research. It knew that the multinational‚Äôs total worldwide capacity for these widgets was only twenty-two thousand units. The nerve! Those negotiators never intended to procure thirty-three thousand widgets. They were only interested in driving up expectations and thereby extracting a price they could then use for leverage.",
"Without question, one of the most dangerous mistakes you can make in a negotiation is trying to ‚Äúsave the adversary,‚Äù as I put it. There can be no saving of the adversary emotionally, intellectually, financially, or on any level. No. None. Never. It‚Äôs a terrible practice that does neither side any good.",
"To my knowledge, corporate America had never once said, ‚ÄúNo, we don‚Äôt think so, we believe in a fair profit for our business. Feel free to say no to us in return, but we‚Äôre not giving you a good piece of our business for nothing. That‚Äôs not a good practice for us and our investors.‚Äù",
"The tougher the negotiation, the more critical it is to understand that if someone in this room has to be unokay, it will be you and not your adversary. When your adversary feels unokay, the barriers go up much faster than you can break them down. But unokayness on your part breaks down barriers‚Äîlike magic, often.",

"Note another element of Switzerland: it is perhaps the most successful country in history, yet it has traditionally had a very low level of university education compared to the rest of the rich nations. Its system, even in banking during my days, was based on apprenticeship models, nearly vocational rather than the theoretical ones. In other words, on techne (crafts and know how), not episteme (book knowledge, know what).",
"Generally religion and puritanism prevail in periods when the laws are feeble and morals must bear the burden of maintaining social order; skepticism and paganism (other factors being equal) progress as the rising power of law and government permits the decline of the church, the family, and morality without basically endangering the stability of the state.",

"The influence of geographic factors diminishes as technology grows. The character and contour of a terrain may offer opportunities for agriculture, mining, or trade, but only the imagination and initiative of leaders, and the hardy industry of followers, can transform the possibilities into fact; and only a similar combination (as in Israel today) can make a culture take form over a thousand natural obstacles.

"The way he handled the material comforts that fortune had supplied him in such abundance‚Äîwithout arrogance and without apology. If they were there, he took advantage of them. If not, he didn‚Äôt miss them.",
So we cannot be sure that the moral laxity of our times is a herald of decay rather than a painful or delightful transition between a moral code that has lost its agricultural basis and another that our industrial civilization has yet to forge into social order and normality.,
We must remind ourselves again that history as usually written (peccavimus) is quite different from history as usually lived: the historian records the exceptional because it is interesting‚Äîbecause it is exceptional.,

"When you don‚Äôt have debt you don‚Äôt care about your reputation in economics circles‚Äîand somehow it is only when you don‚Äôt care about your reputation that you tend to have a good one. Just as in matters of seduction, people lend the most to those who need them the least.",
A key point to bear in mind: The value of attentiveness varies in proportion to its object. You‚Äôre better off not giving the small things more time than they deserve.,
History in the large is the conflict of minorities; the majority applauds the victor and supplies the human material of social experiment.,

It‚Äôs silly to try to escape other people‚Äôs faults. They are inescapable. Just try to escape your own.,
"The fear of capitalism has compelled socialism to widen freedom, and the fear of socialism has compelled capitalism to increase equality. East is West and West is East, and soon the twain will meet.",
"The first step toward antifragility consists in first decreasing downside, rather than increasing upside; that is, by lowering exposure to negative Black Swans and letting natural antifragility work by itself.",

"No one man, however brilliant or well-informed, can come in one lifetime to such fullness of understanding as to safely judge and dismiss the customs or institutions of his society, for these are the wisdom of generations after centuries of experiment in the laboratory of history.",
"If true wealth consists in worriless sleeping, clear conscience, reciprocal gratitude, absence of envy, good appetite, muscle strength, physical energy, frequent laughs, no meals alone, no gym class, some physical labor (or hobby), good bowel movements, no meeting rooms, and periodic surprises, then it is largely subtractive (elimination of iatrogenics).",
"To feel affection for people even when they make mistakes is uniquely human.

"Now let's get to the 22 rules (full recap at the bottom)

Rule #1: You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.

Your audience loves the story - the path - the ups and downs.

For stories, brands, and products - focus on the how and why (and less on the what).",https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1453725972876775424

"Tactic 8: Be Willing to Walk

Sometimes - despite your strongest efforts - deals stall.

At this point, communicate clearly that you can't move any further and that's ok.

You want a QUALITY deal; not just a deal.

If you have built trust throughout, this will be respected.",https://twitter.com/ryantakesoff/status/1441892475627581440

While global oil demand hasn‚Äôt yet reached its pre-pandemic level, global diesel consumption surged to a fresh all-time high in the fourth quarter of 2021. The boom reflects the lopsided Covid economic recovery, with transportation demand spiking to ease supply-chain messes.  European refineries have struggled to match this revival in demand. One key reason is pricey natural gas. Refineries use gas to produce hydrogen, which they then use to remove sulphur from diesel. The spike in gas prices in late 2021 made that process prohibitively expensive, cutting diesel output.‚Äù",https://doomberg.substack.com/p/farmers-on-the-brink?s=r

"In 1971, as the Vietnam War was heading into its sixteenth year, congressmen Robert Steele from Connecticut and Morgan Murphy from Illinois made a discovery that stunned the American public. While visiting the troops, they had learned that over 15 percent of U.S. soldiers stationed there were heroin addicts. Follow-up research revealed that 35 percent of service members in Vietnam had tried heroin and as many as 20 percent were addicted‚Äîthe problem was even worse than they had initially thought.In a finding that completely upended the accepted beliefs about addiction, Robins found that when soldiers who had been heroin users returned home, only 5 percent of them became re-addicted within a year, and just 12 percent relapsed within three years. In other words, approximately nine out of ten soldiers who used heroin in Vietnam eliminated their addiction nearly overnight.

If you want to go into further distortion you can even select the low input impedance. So I wonder how this cannot be enough for you.

There aren't many classical recordings of mine that do not include tube amplification. Spots in particular blend much better with a main array when recorded with a valve amp. This is caused by the slight compression effect that valves give. Spots will not cause dynamic spikes that will stick out in the mix, with that ""decent"" amplification.

1. Provides context (1st sentence).

3. Focused on what a prospect wants but doesn‚Äôt have.

4. Short.

5. Detached (‚Äúno rush‚Äù). Subconscious says, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no pressure here.‚Äù

Even so, it's common to believe that evolution does have an objective, which is to survive and reproduce. This story of survival and reproduction is popular and supports the cultural assumption that all great achievements are driven by objectives. But we should be careful when objective tales are spun around open ended constraints like ""survive and reproduce,"" because meeting a constraint is much different from what is usually meant by objective-driven achievement.",https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-15524-1

"Is any of this animal use necessary? Putting aside instances where people are stranded on lifeboats or desert islands, or otherwise facing imminent starvation, it is not necessary for humans to eat animals or animal products. Indeed, for several decades, a growing number of mainstream healthcare professionals have been telling us that animal foods are not only not necessary for, but are actually detrimental to, human health. Moreover, animal agriculture is an ecological disaster as it is responsible for at least as much greenhouse gas emissions as the burning of fossil fuels for transport, and having many other disastrous consequences. We eat animal foods because we think they taste good, and because we‚Äôve been eating them for a long time. So, although the use of animals for food is not even arguably necessary as a general matter, we ignore that, and ask only whether animals used for food have suffered unnecessarily.",https://aeon.co/essays/why-morality-requires-veganism-the-case-against-owning-animals
"Could we improve animal welfare and accord a greater weight to animal interests in not suffering ‚Äì could we build in a moral component? Sure. Some countries have higher welfare standards than others. But the ability to do this is severely constrained by economic and political considerations, including that markets are less and less national and more and more international, and this limits the ability to deviate significantly from the minimal standards. The result is that the difference between the most ‚Äòhumane‚Äô standards and the least ‚Äòhumane‚Äô standards in terms of what is legally required is almost always the difference between horrible and, at best, moderately less horrible.",https://aeon.co/essays/why-morality-requires-veganism-the-case-against-owning-animals

"A positive void coefficient means that the reactivity increases as the void content inside the reactor increases due to increased boiling or loss of coolant; for example, if the coolant acts predominantly as neutron absorber. This positive void coefficient causes a positive feedback loop, starting with the first occurrence of steam bubbles. This can quickly boil all the coolant in the reactor, if not countered by an (automatic) control mechanism, or if said mechanism's response time is too slow. This happened in the RBMK reactor that was destroyed in the Chernobyl disaster as the automatic control mechanism was mostly disabled (and the operators were trying somewhat recklessly to rapidly restore a high power level. Due to poor control rod design, the operators were unaware that there was a maximal level of neutron poison in the core).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_coefficient

"A negative void coefficient means that the reactivity decreases as the void content inside the reactor increases - but it also means that the reactivity increases if the void content inside the reactor is reduced. In boiling-water reactors with large negative void coefficients, a sudden pressure rise (caused, for example, by unplanned closure of a streamline valve) will result in a sudden decrease in void content: the increased pressure will cause some of the steam bubbles to condense (""collapse""); and the thermal output will possibly increase until it is terminated by safety systems, by increased void formation due to the higher power, or, possibly, by system or component failures that relieve pressure, causing void content to increase and power to decrease. Boiling water reactors are all designed (and required) to handle this type of transient",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_coefficient
"On the other hand, if a reactor is designed to operate with no voids at all, a large negative void coefficient may serve as a safety system. A loss of coolant in such a reactor decreases the thermal output, but of course heat that is generated is no longer removed, so the temperature could rise (if all other safety systems simultaneously failed).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_coefficient

"""Alan Kay has argued (User Interface: A Personal View, 1989), that a more powerful aim is to develop a new medium for thought. A medium such as, say, Adobe Illustrator is essentially different from any of the individual tools Illustrator contains. Such a medium creates a powerful immersive context, a context in which the user can have new kinds of thought, thoughts that were formerly impossible for them. Speaking loosely, the range of expressive thoughts possible in such a medium is an emergent property of the elementary objects and actions in that medium. If those are well chosen, the medium expands the possible range of human thought.""

and demanding that many students leave as many as
ten or twenty questions blank.
Now, here's the interesting part. As it turns
out, the average number of items answered on that
questionnaire varies from country to country. It is
possible, in fact, to rank all the participating countries according to how many items their students
answer on the questionnaire. Now, what do you
think happens if you compare the questionnaire rank-
ings with the math rankings on the TIMSS? They are

With a technical focus on pre-specification, rationalisation and optimization, systems engineering is inherently compatible not only with the modularity of systems for space exploration such as staged rockets and space station assemblies, but also with hierarchical organizational management structures in charge of their production and operation...this approach is based on the presumption that once each subsystem satisfies its respective sub-objectives, then overall objectives are satisfied once all subsystems are integrated into the whole.","https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-18557-2#:~:text=Design%20cybernetics%20describes%20design%20practice,well%20as%20error%20and%20serendipity"

"A Framework For Sharing Your Business Strategy With Employees
To help you think through how to share your business strategy with employees, we offer a proven framework:

¬†

1. Start With Winning Their Hearts. Remind employees what the company‚Äôs vision is, and help them personalize it. When employees have a personal and emotional stake in the company‚Äôs vision, they‚Äôll thirst for the details of the business strategy.

You can use employee surveys to measure changes in understanding of strategy, and determine how operations should change.
You can also ask people what the vision statement means to them. Though anecdotal, if you ask enough people, you will collect enough data points to target more meaningful data collection.",https://www.appliedlearning.com/sharing-strategy-with-employees/

"Reasoning from first principles is a hard thing to do in life, and Musk is a master at it. Brain software has four major decision-making centers:

1) Filling in the Want box

2) Filling in the Reality box

3) Goal selection from the Goal Pool

4) Strategy formation

Musk works through each of these boxes by reasoning from first principles. Filling in the Want box from first principles requires a deep, honest, and independent understanding of yourself. Filling in the Reality box requires the clearest possible picture of the actual facts of both the world and your own abilities. The Goal Pool should double as a Goal Selection Laboratory that contains tools for intelligently measuring and weighing options.

"The human brain is a product of millions of years of evolution, and we are hard-wired with instincts that helped our ancestors to survive in small groups of hunters and gatherers. Our brains often jump to swift conclusions without much thinking, which used to help us to avoid immediate dangers. We are interested in gossip and dramatic stories, which used to be the only source of news and useful information. We crave sugar and fat, which used to be life-saving sources of energy when food was scarce. We have many instincts that used to be useful thousands of years ago, but we live in a very different world now.",

"So make no mistake: pretotypes are not a replacement for prototypes. You don‚Äôt want to jump from pretotype to product, any more than you want to jump from idea to product. Prototypes are a necessary and incredibly useful tool in the new product development process. They can‚Äîand should‚Äîbe used to answer many questions about a potential product, such as: Do we know how to build It? Will It work at all? Will It work as intended? How small/big can we make It? How much would It cost to produce? How long will the batteries last? ‚Ä¶ ",
"Most people believe that they are working on an idea that, if competently executed, will succeed. But we know that can‚Äôt be true. ",

False Positive opinions about our idea can make us overconfident and blind us to The Law of Failure. And in doing so, they get us to commit to building It before we have sufficient evidence of market interest‚Äîthe Go For It scenario. ",

"If we come at behavior with the cool disinterest of an alien observer, we are likely to notice
three things. Behavior starts, it happens, and then it ends. It starts because something captures
attention: the actuator, a cue, a motivator, signal, context, or stimulus. It happens because the
behavior is known or the environment provides appropriate affordances‚Äîproperties of the
environment that guide the behavior. It ends because consequences are achieved or there are
no further apparent actions to take to achieve them. In many cases anticipating the
consequences can help initiate the behavior to begin with",
"I used to get very sad and lonely whenever my wife, Bonnie, was away for more than a day. If she traveled for a weekend or, God forbid, a week, I would feel bereft and depressed. Once I learned IFS, I realized that these feelings were coming from a Deprived Child Part of me who was left alone in an incubator for weeks after I was born prematurely, and then didn‚Äôt get enough nurturing from my mother.",
"Method 2: The Pinocchio pretotype is best suited for situations where factors like size, shape, weight and/or portability, are important and where one‚Äôs imagination can be used to fill in the blanks in terms of functionality.",
"Methods Overview: The Mechanical Turk‚ÄîReplace complex and expensive computers or machines with human beings. The Pinocchio‚ÄîBuild a dummy, non-functional version of the product and bring it to life with your imagination. The Stripped Tease‚ÄîCreate a functional version of your idea, but stripped down to its most basic functionality. The Provincial‚ÄîBefore launching broadly, run a test on a very small sample. The Fake Door‚ÄîCreate a fake entry-point for a product that doesn‚Äôt yet exist in any form. The Pretend-to-Own‚ÄîBefore investing to buy whatever you need to develop your idea, rent, or borrow it first. The Re-Label‚ÄîPut a different label on an existing product that looks like the product you want to create. ",
"Method 3: The Stripped Tease Pretotype If a new product is something that people really, really want, they will put up with limited features and rough edges. The Stripped Tease pretotype takes advantage of this fact. Since a Stripped Tease pretotype must offer some actual (although limited) functionality, it often involves a greater investment of time and money than, say, a Mechanical Turk or a Pinocchio pretotype.",
"Method 4: The Provincial In many cases, the major costs associated with a new product idea are not in developing the basic functionality, but in scaling the product to support and making it useful for a very large number of users. A Provincial pretotype provides the core features of the intended final product but limits its scope and scale to support only a small subset of the ultimate target market. ",
"Method 5: With a Fake Door pretotype, all you have to do is create an entry point for a new product (or new feature). The product (or feature) does not have to exist yet. In Jess‚Äôs words, ‚ÄúIn a web product, what this means is that you pretend that a feature exists, and you see if anybody clicks on it.‚Äù  ",
"Method 6: The Pretend-To-Own Many ideas require major upfront capital investments (tools, materials, equipment) before they can become a product or service. In such cases, instead of making that capital outlay‚Äîa mistake that I see happen all the time‚Äî it‚Äôs essential that you first create your pretotype by borrowing or renting what you need. ",
"... so we asked them to evaluate their pretotype experiments using a flow-chart that included questions such as:  - Is it legal?  - Does it align with Stanford Values and Policies - Would you feel comfortable if others knew about it or knew you did it?  - Would you want to read about it in tomorrow‚Äôs news?  If the answer to any of these questions was ‚Äúno,‚Äù they could not proceed.  Period. If the answers were mostly ‚Äúyes,‚Äù with perhaps a ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù or two, they were advised to seek advice and/or permission through the university‚Äôs Office of Compliance and Ethics.",
"The first metric you should use to test the market‚Äôs interest in your idea is Initial Level of Interest, ILI for short. ILI is a simple ratio: ILI = number of actions taken / number of opportunities for action offered

"These days, in addition to dedicated online forums, Reddit interest groups (subreddits) are a great place to pretotype and test your ideas.",
"Ongoing Level of Interest (OLI):
Unlike the ILI, which can be represented by a single number, the Ongoing Level of Interest (OLI) is best represented by a time-based table. Each entry in the table represents the level of interest over time. What you should be looking for in the OLI table is a trend. Three basic trends are possible: 1) If, over time, the OLI fades to zero, or close to that, then you are probably dealing with an idea that is The Wrong It‚Äîunless it‚Äôs the kind of idea that is meant to be a one-time purchase or a passing fad, like the proverbial Pet Rock. 2) If the OLI drops a bit from the Initial Level of Interest but eventually settles at a lower but still acceptable level (let‚Äôs say you go from an ILI of 11% to an OLI of 7%), you need to determine if this lower level of interest is sufficient to support a profitable business.

"The problem is that the stepping stones to intelligence do not resemble intel ligence at all. Put another way, human-level intelligence is a deceptive objective for evolution. Once again, deception rears its confusing and misdirecting head. Rather than increasing intelligence, the stepping stones that lead from single-celled organisms to humans include such unrelated innovations as multicellularity and bilateral symmetry.
...
Even so, it's common to believe that evolution does have an objective, which is to survive and reproduce. This story of survival and reproduction is popular and supports the cultural assumption that all great achievements are driven by objectives. But we should be careful when objective tales are spun around open ended constraints like ""survive and reproduce,"" because meeting a constraint is much different from what is usually meant by objective-driven achievement.",https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-15524-1

We're trapped in a  story that sees ourselves as independent, isolated agents acting in the  world. But that self is an illusion.

"At least at the beginning, the Spring Grove psychedelic work enjoyed lots of public support. In 1965, CBS News broadcast an admiring hour long ""special report"" on the hospital's work with alcoholics, called LSD: The Spring Grove Experiment. The response to the program was so positive that the Maryland state legislature established a multimillion-dollar research facility on the campus of the Spring Grove State Hospital, called the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center. Stan Grof, Walter Pahnke, and Bill Richards were hired to help run it, along with several dozen other therapists, psychiatrists, pharmacologists, and support staff. Equally hard to believe today is the fact that, as Richards told me, ""whenever we hired someone, they would receive a couple of LSD sessions as part of their training to do the work.

"tumor cells evade immunotherapy by generating unique transient cell-in-cell structures, which are resistant to killing by T cells and chemotherapies. While the outer cells in this cell-in-cell formation are often killed by reactive T cells, the inner cells remain intact and disseminate into single tumor cells once T cells are no longer present. This formation is mediated predominantly by IFNŒ≥-activated T cells, which subsequently induce phosphorylation of the transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and early growth response-1 (EGR-1) in tumor cells. Indeed, inhibiting these factors prior to immunotherapy significantly improves its therapeutic efficacy. Overall, this work highlights a currently insurmountable limitation of immunotherapy and reveals a previously unknown resistance mechanism which enables tumor cells to survive immune-mediated killing without altering their immunogenicity.

Over time, meaning over the course of twelve or more months, there is a well documented effect of the anxiety relief that cannabis and THC initially brought, being less and less potent.

It is created by an organization that perceives it as real. This means that organizations differ from each other not just in terms of the framework they use to react to a reality, but also in terms of the framework they use to perceive a reality, and that framework, in its turn, is formed through the interpretation of that reality.

"Machine learning is being sold as a tool that researchers can learn in a few hours and use by themselves ‚Äî and many follow that advice, says Sayash Kapoor, a machine-learning researcher at Princeton. ‚ÄúBut you wouldn‚Äôt expect a chemist to be able to learn how to run a lab using an online course,‚Äù he says. And few scientists realize that the problems they encounter when applying artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are common to other fields, says Kapoor, who has co-authored a preprint on the ‚Äòcrisis‚Äô1. Peer reviewers do not have the time to scrutinize these models, so academia currently lacks mechanisms to root out irreproducible papers, he says. Kapoor and his co-author Arvind Narayanan created guidelines for scientists to avoid such pitfalls, including an explicit checklist to submit with each paper.

"Kapoor and Narayanan‚Äôs definition of reproducibility is wide. It says that other teams should be able to replicate the results of a model, given the full details on data, code and conditions ‚Äî often termed computational reproducibility, something that is already a concern for machine-learning scientists. The pair also define a model as irreproducible when researchers make errors in data analysis that mean that the model is not as predictive as claimed.

"The failures are not the fault of any individual researcher, he adds. Instead, a combination of hype around AI and inadequate checks and balances is to blame. The most prominent issue that Kapoor and Narayanan highlight is ‚Äòdata leakage‚Äô, when information from the data set a model learns on includes data that it is later evaluated on. If these are not entirely separate, the model has effectively already seen the answers, and its predictions seem much better than they really are. The team has identified eight major types of data leakage that researchers can be vigilant against.

"Wider issues include training models on datasets that are narrower than the population that they are ultimately intended to reflect, says Malik. For example, an AI that spots pneumonia in chest X-rays that was trained only on older people might be less accurate on younger individuals. Another problem is that algorithms often end up relying on shortcuts that don‚Äôt always hold, says Jessica Hullman, a computer scientist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, who will speak at the workshop. For example, a computer vision algorithm might learn to recognize a cow by the grassy background in most cow images, so it would fail when it encounters an image of the animal on a mountain or beach.

"The central problem is publication bias. Publication bias stems from the practice that scientific top journals typically only publish studies that have statistically significant results. A significant result is one in which, according to a statistical test as well as convention, an experimental effect cannot be attributed to mere chance. Editors of top journals want to publish results that have a wide impact. Statistically significant results promise more citations than so-called null-results with no statistically significant effect. This selection behavior, in turn, influences the behavior of researchers. Authors of scientific studies have an incentive to look for statistically significant results. This again has important implications. As null-results are not worth to be written up, they ‚Äúremain in the drawer‚Äù. Other researchers do not learn about them",https://verfassungsblog.de/nudging-after-the-replication-crisis/
" Therefore, a recent study by Stefano DellaVigna and Elizabeth Linos is particularly interesting. The study compares the effect sizes of randomized control trials (RCTs) in scientific journal publications with those in studies conducted by nudge units. The special feature here is that the authors had access to all studies of two leading nudge units based in the USA. This allows them to overcome the publication bias on the one hand and to make it visible in comparison with the journal studies on the other. The interesting result is that the trials of the nudge units also have statistically significant effects, but these amount to only one-sixth the size of the effects in the scientific publications. In their estimate, DellaVigna and Linos explain most of the difference with publication bias.",https://verfassungsblog.de/nudging-after-the-replication-crisis/

"The social critic Camille Paglia sees this rise in domination and submission as a collective fantasy that tweaks the rough spots of our egalitarian culture. It seems to me that rituals of domination and submission are a subversive way to put one over on a society that glorifies control, belittles dependency, and demands equality. In cultures where these values are at a premium‚ÄîAmerica, for example‚Äîwe find more and more people seeking to give up control, revel in dependency, and recognize the very inequities no one wants to talk about.",

" There is a pair of ideas that you must understand in order to do inference correctly:

Each observation can either be used for exploration or confirmation, not both.

You can use an observation as many times as you like for exploration, but you can only use it once for confirmation. As soon as you use an observation twice, you‚Äôve switched from confirmation to exploration.

This is necessary because to confirm a hypothesis you must use data independent of the data that you used to generate the hypothesis. Otherwise you will be over optimistic. There is absolutely nothing wrong with exploration, but you should never sell an exploratory analysis as a confirmatory analysis because it is fundamentally misleading.",https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-intro.html#model-intro
"If you are serious about doing an confirmatory analysis, one approach is to split your data into three pieces before you begin the analysis:

60% of your data goes into a training (or exploration) set. You‚Äôre allowed to do anything you like with this data: visualise it and fit tons of models to it.

20% goes into a query set. You can use this data to compare models or visualisations by hand, but you‚Äôre not allowed to use it as part of an automated process.

20% is held back for a test set. You can only use this data ONCE, to test your final model.",https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-intro.html#model-intro

"Es kann sich also f√ºr Staaten auszahlen, einen Teil ihrer formellen, aber unwirksamen Souver√§nit√§t aufzugeben, um im Verbund mit anderen Staaten ihre faktische Autonomie zu erh√∂hen.
Zum einen sind sie gemeinsam gegen√ºber Drittstaaten st√§rker. Hier √§hnelt der realistische IG der realistischen Allianztheorie. Je gr√∂sser die externe Bedrohung ist und je weniger Staaten in der Lage sind, darauf autonom zu reagieren, desto eher sind sie zur Integration bereit. Zum anderen st√§rkt die Integration von starken und schwachen Staaten die schw√§cheren Staaten, weil sie die st√§rkeren Staaten an gemeinsame Regeln und Verfahren bindet und den politischen Einfluss der schw√§cheren Staaten durch Stimmrechte und durch die Vertretung in den supranationalen Organen erh√∂ht.",

Das ist unter ande- rem die Aufgabe der Europ√§ischen Kommission und des Europ√§ischen Gerichtshofs. Auch in dieser Hinsicht sind die supranationalen Organe jedoch eher Instrumente der Staaten als autonome Akteure. Indem sie Kompetenzen an EU-Organe delegieren, entziehen die Regierungen die Verhandlungsergebnisse dem Zugriff der Innenpolitik ‚Äì beispielsweise unzufriedenen Interessengruppen oder den Oppositionsparteien nach einem Regierungswechsel.",
"In den 60er Jahren schien der anf√§ngliche Konsens nicht mehr f√ºr weitere Integrationsschritte auszureichen; dementsprechend kam es zu Blockaden in der Beschlussfassung und in der Folge zu einem allm√§hlichen Aus- und Umbau der drei mittlerweile fusionierten Gemeinschaften. Zum einen wurde die EG um neue Mitgliedstaaten erweitert, zum anderen wurden neue Institutionen geschaffen und bestehende gest√§rkt. Des Weiteren wurden die Politikfunktionen der EG erheblich ausgeweitet. Trotz dieser weitgehenden Integrationsschritte wird die zweite Phase gemeinhin als Stagnationsphase gewertet. ",
"Der PF nimmt hingegen an, dass die anf√§ngliche Integration zu negativen Reaktionen auf der nationalen Ebene f√ºhrt, die den weiteren Integrationsprozess einschr√§nken. Sie mobilisiert W√§hler, die als Konsequenz der Integration nicht nur um ihren Wohlstand, sondern auch um ihre nationale Selbstbestimmung f√ºrchten, und st√§rkt Parteien, die diese √Ñngste aufgreifen. In den Verhandlungen sind die Regierungen daher in ihrem Spielraum eingeschr√§nkt.

"Der NF sieht einen positiven Feedbackprozess am Werk, der Akteure und Institutionen jenseits und oberhalb der Staaten st√§rkt. Durch die anf√§ngliche Integration entstehen transnationale Interessengruppen (z. B. multinationale Firmen und europ√§ische Interessenverb√§nde), die ihre wirtschaftlichen Interessen am besten im europ√§ischen Rahmen aufgehoben sehen, und supranationale Organe, die ein organisatorisches Eigeninteresse am Integrationswachstum besitzen. Sie nutzen ihre institutionellen Kompetenzen und informellen Ressourcen (z. B. ihre √ºberlegene Expertise), um Einfluss auf die Verhandlungsprozesse zu nehmen. Ausserdem leiten supranationale Normen und Regeln die Regierungsverhandlungen in integrationsfreundliche Bahnen.",
"Der historische Institutionalismus stellt zwar nicht in Frage, dass Regierungen internationale Institutionen gr√ºnden, um in einem interdependenten internationalen System ihr nationales Interesse zu f√∂rdern und ihre Wohlfahrt zu steigern. Er bestreitet jedoch, dass Institutionen im weiteren Zeitverlauf wirksam und verl√§sslich entsprechend den Vorgaben ihrer Gr√ºnder arbeiten. Politische Akteure handeln in der Regel kurzfristig und kurzsichtig; ihre Zeithorizonte sind begrenzt.",
"Die Spillover-Mechanismen erkl√§ren aus neofunktionalistischer Perspektive, warum das von den Regierungen verhandelte und vereinbarte Integrationsniveau instabil ist und Druck zugunsten weiterer Integration entsteht. Allerdings stehen die Regierungen diesem Ver√§nderungsdruck nicht hilflos gegen√ºber. Sie verf√ºgen unter allen an der Integration beteiligten Akteuren √ºber die st√§rksten Machtressourcen und k√∂nnen unerw√ºnschte Entwicklungen durch vertragliche Korrekturen prinzipiell stoppen oder r√ºckg√§ngig machen. Der NF muss also zus√§tzlich erkl√§ren k√∂nnen, warum die Regierungen diese Ressourcen und Kompetenzen nicht wirksam nutzen (k√∂nnen).",
"Die nationalen Interessen k√∂nnen sich jedoch als Konsequenz der Integration ver- schieben und ver√§ndern. Beispielsweise k√∂nnen wettbewerbsschwache Unterneh- men und Wirtschaftsbereiche, die zun√§chst als Bremser der Integration aktiv waren, durch die Integration geschw√§cht werden oder vom Markt verschwinden. Gleich- zeitig gehen Firmen und Interessengruppen, die von der Integration profitieren, gest√§rkt aus der anf√§nglichen Integrationsphase hervor. Dadurch verschieben sich die innerstaatlichen Machtverh√§ltnisse zugunsten integrationsfreundlicher Akteure und die Verhandlungspositionen der Regierungen zugunsten weiterer Integration.",
"W√§hrend in der funktionalen Logik eine Vergr√∂sserung politischer Einheiten aus Effizienzgr√ºnden oft w√ºnschenswert ist, f√ºhrt sie aus postfunktionaler Perspektive zu grundlegenden Konflikten mit dem Ziel der Selbstbestimmung, zum einen im Hinblick auf B√ºrgerpartizipation und B√ºrgereinfluss (Dahl 1999, S. 21 f.), zum anderen im Hinblick auf Identit√§t und Gemeinsinn (Z√ºrn 1998, S. 237 ff.).",

Unofficial membership status of around a dozen members.
Each member works on personal or collaborative projects and is held accountable through a combination of regular talks and presentations.
Members are unconstrained in what their project topics are, but they would fall roughly under the domain of ‚Äòexplorative technology‚Äô. Members are probably interested in some subset of Dynamicland, doing weird stuff with GANs, interesting data visualisations, Tools for Thought and Second Brains, tech-related art projects, reconceptualising programming, writing explorative essays, hardware experiments, and things that cannot be put in a list such as this.

"In its most practical instantiation, ML is best used as an automatic task solver. To illustrate this point, let‚Äôs consider the supervised learning paradigm. Provided with enough high-quality training data, an ML system can be trained to make high-quality predictions from real-world input data that it has never seen before. What‚Äôs important here is both the quality of the system‚Äôs output and the scale at which the system can be deployed while still offering economic value. The amount of value created will vary as a function of several variables. These might include the user persona (enterprise vs. small business), how important the target task is to their workflow, how closely this workflow is aligned with a profit or cost centre for the business, and how much of the workflow can be eaten away if the task is solved.¬†",https://sifted.eu/articles/machine-learning-full-stack/

"contradiction between being made of matter that behaves in a predictable way, and the feeling that I could choose to do whatever I wanted. At the time I had a self-interested motive for exploring the question. At that age (like most succeeding ages) I was always in trouble with the authorities, and it seemed to me that there might possibly be some way to get out of trouble by arguing that I wasn't responsible for my actions. I gradually lost hope of that, but the puzzle remained: How do you reconcile being a machine made of matter with the feeling that you're free to choose what you do? [1]

"The best way to explain the answer may be to start with a slightly wrong version, and then fix it. The wrong version is: You can do what you want, but you can't want what you want. Yes, you can control what you do, but you'll do what you want, and you can't control that.
",http://paulgraham.com/want.html
"We can get arbitrarily close to a true statement by adding more ""want to""s in much the same way we can get arbitrarily close to 1 by adding more 9s to a string of 9s following a decimal point. In practice three or four ""want to""s must surely be enough. It's hard even to envision what it would mean to change what you want to want to want to want, let alone actually do it.

So one way to express the correct answer is to use a regular expression. You can do what you want, but there's some statement of the form ""you can't (want to)* want what you want"" that's true. Ultimately you get back to a want that you don't control.",http://paulgraham.com/want.html

"Sexual desire does not obey the laws that maintain peace and contentment between partners. Reason, understanding, compassion, and camaraderie are the handmaidens of a close, harmonious relationship. But sex often evokes unreasoning obsession rather than thoughtful judgment, and selfish desire rather than altruistic consideration. Aggression, objectification, and power all exist in the shadow of desire, components of passion that do not necessarily nurture intimacy.",
"If love is an act of imagination, then intimacy is an act of fruition. It waits for the high to subside so it can patiently insert itself into the relationship. The seeds of intimacy are time and repetition. We choose each other again and again, and so create a community of two.",
"Man does not like to admit to himself that he is afraid, for this weakens his self-esteem and shakes his faith in the security of his ego.",

"man can only become conscious of it, not as metaphysical truth but as spiritual freedom, by seeing his own nature as it is and relaxing that contraction (sankocha) of egoistic pride which will not let his nature be as it is, and which is forever trying to get away from it by making a virtue of acceptance.",
"Everything is going just as it should go; the daily routine may be a little dull, but it is by no means unbearable. Certainly there are troubles, but nothing overwhelming. As for one‚Äôs own character, well, that is quite normal. There are no serious neurotic troubles and no moral defects. For the most part life is quite agreeable and if death comes at the end of it, that is a matter of course for which nature will prepare us; when the time comes to die we shall be tired and ready to go. That is not a happy life, even though it may be contented; it is simple vegetation.",
"For what do we find left in religion when its quasi-scientific aspect is removed? There is the whole, vast problem of love or spiritual union which is contained in the question, ‚ÄúHow can I learn to love life, whose source and essence we call God? How can I learn to be united with it in all its expressions, in living and dying, in love and fear, in the outer world of circumstances, and in the inner world of thought and feeling, so that in union with it I may find freedom?‚Äù",

"‚ÄúI‚Äôm slow to respond because I need to prioritize some important projects, but if your message is urgent, send me a text.‚Äù",

You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.",
The first step of this strategy is to identify the main high-level goals in both your professional and your personal life.,
"‚ÄúWho you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love‚Äîis the sum of what you focus on.‚Äù",
Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.,
You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it.,

"On your first day using Make Time, we suggest trying one tactic from each step. That is, one new tactic to help you make time for your Highlight, one that keeps you laser-focused by changing how you react to distractions, and one for building energy‚Äîthree tactics total.",
"The first step is choosing a single highlight to prioritize in your day. Next, you‚Äôll employ specific tactics to stay laser-focused on that highlight‚Äîwe‚Äôll offer a menu of tricks to beat distraction in an always-connected world. Throughout the day, you‚Äôll build energy so you can stay in control of your time and attention. Finally, you‚Äôll reflect on the day with a few simple notes.",
The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.,
"Regardless of where you work, be sure to also give yourself a specific time frame to keep the session a discrete challenge and not an open-ended slog.",
"If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment.",
"I know of executives and investors who keep a ‚Äúdecision journal‚Äù in which they record the major decisions they make each week, why they made them, and what they expect the outcome to be. They review their choices at the end of each month or year to see where they were correct and where they went wrong.",
"The concept is simple: By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task. This boost in importance reduces your mind‚Äôs instinct to procrastinate and delivers an injection of motivation and energy.",
"Your goal is not to stick to a given schedule at all costs; it‚Äôs instead to maintain, at all times, a thoughtful say in what you‚Äôre doing with your time going forward‚Äîeven if these decisions are reworked again and again as the day unfolds.",
"The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.",
You don‚Äôt need a rarified job; you need instead a rarified approach to your work.,
"Fixed-schedule productivity, in other words, is a meta-habit that‚Äôs simple to adopt but broad in its impact. If you have to choose just one behavior that reorients your focus toward the deep, this one should be high on your list of possibilities.",
One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.,
"For an individual focused on deep work, it‚Äôs easy to identify the relevant lead measure: time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal.",

"The first three laws of behavior change‚Äîmake it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy‚Äîincrease the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change‚Äîmake it satisfying‚Äîincreases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time. It completes the habit loop.",
A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.,
"It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action. As Voltaire once wrote, ‚ÄúThe best is the enemy of the good.‚Äù",
"‚ÄúIf I organize my life in such a way that I get lots of long, consecutive, uninterrupted time-chunks, I can write novels. [If I instead get interrupted a lot] what replaces it? Instead of a novel that will be around for a long time‚Ä¶ there is a bunch of e-mail messages that I have sent out to individual persons.‚Äù",
The 1st Law of Behavior Change is to make it obvious. Strategies like implementation intentions and habit stacking are among the most practical ways to create obvious cues for your habits and design a clear plan for when and where to take action.,
"I call this commitment fixed-schedule productivity, as I fix the firm goal of not working past a certain time, then work backward to find productivity strategies that allow me to satisfy this declaration.",
"The key here isn‚Äôt to avoid or even to reduce the total amount of time you spend engaging in distracting behavior, but is instead to give yourself plenty of opportunities throughout your evening to resist switching to these distractions at the slightest hint of boredom.",
"The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit.",
Clarity about what matters provides clarity about what does not.,
This brings us to the question of what deliberate practice actually requires. Its core components are usually identified as follows: (1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you‚Äôre trying to improve or an idea you‚Äôre trying to master; (2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it‚Äôs most productive.,
"If you don‚Äôt produce, you won‚Äôt thrive‚Äîno matter how skilled or talented you are.",
"Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable to the brain as vitamin D is to the body, and deprived of it we suffer a mental affliction as disfiguring as rickets‚Ä¶ it is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done.",
"The Principle of Least Resistance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.",

"The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.",
"Ultimately, your habits matter because they help you become the type of person you wish to be. They are the channel through which you develop your deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become your habits.",
"When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.",
"‚ÄúWhen nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it‚Äîbut all that had gone before.‚Äù",
Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.,
Point #1: This strategy works even if your job requires lots of Internet use and/or prompt e-mail replies.,
"Though Grant‚Äôs productivity depends on many factors, there‚Äôs one idea in particular that seems central to his method: the batching of hard but important intellectual work into long, uninterrupted stretches.",
Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don‚Äôt simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction.,
Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way.,
The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained.,
"If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You don‚Äôt need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need to get your reps in.",
"The Law of the Vital Few*: In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes.",
"Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.",

Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them.,
"Chapter Summary The 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it easy. The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning. Focus on taking action, not being in motion. Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition. The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.",
The central idea is to create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. Much of the battle of building better habits comes down to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with our good habits and increase the friction associated with our bad ones.,
The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.,
Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.,
"‚ÄúPeople experiencing attention residue after switching tasks are likely to demonstrate poor performance on that next task,‚Äù and the more intense the residue, the worse the performance.",
"There is a popular notion that artists work from inspiration‚Äîthat there is some strike or bolt or bubbling up of creative mojo from who knows where‚Ä¶ but I hope [my work] makes clear that waiting for inspiration to strike is a terrible, terrible plan. In fact, perhaps the single best piece of advice I can offer to anyone trying to do creative work is to ignore inspiration.",
"To simply wait and be bored has become a novel experience in modern life, but from the perspective of concentration training, it‚Äôs incredibly valuable.",
Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you permanently reduce your capacity to perform deep work.,

The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.,
"Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine.",
"The two core abilities just described depend on your ability to perform deep work. If you haven‚Äôt mastered this foundational skill, you‚Äôll struggle to learn hard things or produce at an elite level.",
"When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive.",

Starting at the top he falls, instinctively and unconsciously, to the bottom, at which point they say he enters the extreme of materiality and self-consciousness, the age of Kali Yuga.

But man rejects his freedom to do them, imagining that death, fear, and sorrow are the causes of his unhappiness. The real cause is that he does not let himself be free to accept them, for he does not understand that he who is free to love is not really free unless he is also free to fear, and this is the freedom of happiness.",
"In Christianity the idea of total acceptance is somewhat hidden; it is only spoken of directly in some of the writings of the mystics, but it is soon discovered when we begin to make a thorough search into the symbolism of Christian doctrine. In the religions of the East, however, it is given particular emphasis; in fact, it is the fundamental principle of Vedantist, Buddhist, and Taoist philosophy. The chief difference between these Eastern religions and Christianity is that, on the surface at least, Christianity is concerned with belief in doctrines whereas the Eastern religions are concerned with states of mind. That is to say, Christianity tends to be a theological and ethical religion, while Buddhism, Taoism, and Vedanta are psychological religions.",

"The labour required to culture meat is highly technical and involves carefully monitoring, maintaining and adjusting bioreactors without compromising the fragile aseptic environments that cell growth requires. That‚Äôs the polar opposite of fast-paced slaughter and dismemberment labour, which results in, on average, two amputations of hands, fingers, feet or limbs a week in the US.",
"Perhaps the best way to overcome these challenges is to deploy the same strategy that the US government used to industrialise farming a century ago: invest robustly in research and development through public universities, national labs and generous subsidies. Between talk of the Green New Deal and the Biden administration‚Äôs ambitions for comprehensive climate crisis policy, the window for public investment in environmentally responsible technology is unusually wide. Substantial and continued government investment in cellular agriculture could be a part of whatever legislation emerges. More broadly, governments should learn from economists such as Mariana Mazzucato, who argue that mission-driven public investment in innovation is crucial to serving the public good. We are already seeing some of this sort of proactive investment and regulation in places such as Singapore and Israel.",
"could help restructure agricultural land use by reducing demand for animal feed, thereby opening up space for more progressive food politics. establishing agro-ecological and regenerative farms that are a foundation for healthier rural communities and landscapes; supporting community and worker-owned farms; providing land to people from communities that have been historically dispossessed and excluded from owning land; returning lands to tribal nations; rewilding and conservation initiatives. Many of these ideas are championed by critics of cultured meat, who often suggest it is incompatible with the holistic, ecological sensibilities of slow, small and local. But all of these ideas become more feasible in a world with commercially viable ‚Äúlabriculture‚Äù.",
"A world in which the factory-farmed nugget is replaced by the bioreactor-brewed nugget would be a monumental win for animals and the environment. If tied to progressive industrial and agricultural policy, it could also be a win for labour, public investment, land use and champions of sustainable agriculture. No, this would not be a one-shot, magic bullet solution to the many ills of food production; there is no panacea. But it‚Äôs a start.

In the Bitcoin network, the verification and validation of transactions is made according to the Proof of Work consensus protocol. But some more recent blockchains are based on another consensus mechanism for verification and validation called Proof of Stake. Here are the main differences.


Another main difference is what PoS allows you to do with your coins: staking. It provides you with the option to generate passive income. By owning such coins, you can delegate some of your assets to a validator. The validator is rewarded with fees and shares parts of it with you. In other words, PoS allows you to grow your assets without doing anything. You don‚Äôt even need to be a validator.""

"Situations often arise in which people are not sure about what kind of person they are dealing with. These are games of incomplete information, where players are uncertain about the characteristics of the other player and so are uncertain about the payoffs from the possible outcomes of the game.

A player typically knows his or her own type, but it is unknown to the other player. Hence there is asymmetric information.",

"These arise for two principal reasons: first, that twentieth-century, civilized man is so centered in his own limited self-consciousness that he is quite unaware of its origin, of the directing forces that lie beneath it; and second, that the real problem is not to bring about a state of affairs which does not as yet exist, but to realize something which is already happening‚Äî‚Äúas it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be.‚Äù For although civilized man appears to live only from his self-conscious center, although he appears divorced from nature, from a spiritual point of view this is a mere conceit. In other words, at this very moment we have that union and harmony in spite of ourselves; we create spiritual problems simply through not being aware of it, and that lack of understanding causes and in turn is caused by the delusion of self-sufficiency. As Christianity would say, the Grace of God is always being freely offered; the problem is to get man to accept it and give up the conc",

"The Christian belief that only one historical religious tradition is valid for man is a clear enough sign of this confusion; so much emphasis is placed on history and doctrine as the essentials of salvation that a psychology of religion independent of the person of Christ is not understood. In the three great Eastern religions this confusion does not exist, and from them we are able to form a much clearer idea of the essentials of religion, of the state of mind called spiritual experience as distinct from the ‚Äúlocal color‚Äù of particular historical events. For if indeed this experience is attainable outside the Christian faith, apart from devotion to a particular personality, and even without reference to theology (as in certain forms of Buddhism), then Eastern religions have two important contributions to make to Western civilization. Firstly, they show the principles of an approach to spiritual experience on a purely psychological basis to those who have lost faith in the historical a",

There are also situations where players have imperfect information about the game tree: players‚Äô past actions may be either unobservable or imperfectly observable. This means that players do not know exactly which decision node they are on in the game tree.,
"One of the founding fathers of experimental economics, Reinhard Selten (who shared the 1994 Nobel Prize in Economics with John Nash and John Charles Harsanyi), conducted an experiment with participants who played a version of the repeated Prisoners‚Äô Dilemma Game for real money. Players were uncertain about the number of repetitions, but they knew that the experiment wouldn‚Äôt last longer than a certain amount of time. The experiment‚Äôs results were broadly in line with game theory. Cooperative outcomes were often recorded as long as the end of the game was not in sight.

"Efficiency wages pose a problem, however, in that all firms are faced with the same incentive to offer higher wages to induce efficiency. But if each firm introduces a higher wage, wages increase in the marketplace.

In this case, employees will be motivated to work hard because if they lose their job it might take them a long time to find a new one. If my boss catches me Shirking and I lose my job.",
"For instance, we might look at a firm deciding on whether to advertise or not. In this simple representation, it chooses whichever option gives the higher payoff.

"The consumer can reason that only a company with a reliable product could afford to offer a long-term warranty, since there would be relatively few claims made.

"By using the standard deviation, Pearson made it possible to measure all the points of variation on a distribution rather than the two or three points that Galton had offered in his quartile range.",
"Advertising works as a signalling device because of a simple cost-benefit analysis. The cost of advertising is the same no matter what quality of product the firm sells. But the benefit from advertising is much higher for a firm producing a high-quality product since new customers will make repeat purchases. For the same advertising expense, a firm selling a low-quality product can get only one-off purchases from first-time customers. Therefore, a high level of advertising can only be profitable for a firm with high-quality goods.",
"a separating equilibrium, a firm‚Äôs choice of warranty depends on the type of its product (high-quality or low-quality). A firm with a high-quality product chooses to offer warranty, but a firm with low-quality product chooses not to. Through self-selection, the warranty allows a high-quality product firm to differentiate itself from a low-quality product firm. The two different types separate themselves through their behaviour.",
"One might think that preventing resources from working continuously will decrease throughput (output) of the operation. That undesirable effect might have been the result if Ford would have been satisfied with just limiting the space. But, there is another effect that stems from restricting the accumulation of inventory. It makes it very visible to spot the real problems that jeopardize the flow‚Äîwhen one work center in a line stops producing for more than a short while, soon the whole line stops. Ford took advantage of the resulting clear visibility to better balance the flow by addressing and eliminating the apparent stoppages.4 The end result of abolishing local efficiencies and balancing the flow is a substantial increase in throughput. Henry Ford achieved the highest throughput per worker of any car manufacturing company of his time.",
"Human behaviour is probably better approximated by bounded rationality. That is, human rationality is limited by the tractability of the decision problem (how easy it is to manage), the cognitive limitations of our minds, the time available in which to make the decision, and how important the decision is to us.",
"The idea of Nash equilibrium is both simple and powerful: in equilibrium each rational player chooses his or her best response to the choice of the other player. That is, he or she chooses the best action given what the other player is doing.",
"To understand when players collude in a Prisoners‚Äô Dilemma type of situation, we need to move beyond one-shot games (where players play the game only once and then the game ends) and to start thinking about more realistic settings with repeated interaction, where players play the same game again and again. We are both in this business for the long haul.",
"Pearson first encountered variables that could not be treated as continuous when he began to look at the inheritance of eye colour in man and colour of coat in horses and dogs. In these situations, the only form of classification available for the variables is one that involves ‚Äúcounting‚Äù, rather than ‚Äúmeasuring‚Äù: eye colour cannot be measured in the same way that stature, weight or time can be measured. Pearson referred to such variables as eye colour as nominal. Nominal variables include nearly all demographic variables such as religious affiliation, political persuasion and socio-economic status.",
"However, risk concentration where there is no information advantage is a recipe for ruin.",
"Persistent unemployment presents a puzzle for standard economic analysis: if there is unemployment, then for each job opening there are many applicants. In that case, firms can offer lower wages and still fill all vacancies. With lower wages, hiring is cheaper and firms employ more workers. It seems like wages should eventually adjust downward to the point where the number of people who want to work equals the number jobs.",
"Macroeconomists, who are interested in large-scale economic patterns and effects, often study the problem of persistent unemployment, a situation in which there are people who are willing to work but who cannot find a job.",
"For instance, in the car insurance market a driver has private information about their own driving habits. The insurance company has incomplete information: it doesn‚Äôt know the driver‚Äôs habits, so it doesn‚Äôt know the payoffs it will get from selling them insurance.

One of the features of Nash equilibrium is that it is regret free.,
"Curvilinear Relationships Though the numerical index provides some information about the degree of a linear relationship, a scatter plot is a useful tool, because it may reveal instead a curvilinear relationship. Pearson introduced the correlation ratio in 1905 to measure a curvilinear relationship. An age over lifetime growth curve is curvilinear, whereas an early childhood growth curve is linear. Infants continue to grow until adolescence: they get taller, their hair grows, and they also become more dextrous, agile and flexible. But the lifespan is curvilinear because a number of these characteristics diminish among the elderly:‚Ä¶",

If two variables produce a narrow ellipse that resembles a straight line, this would indicate a high correlation. A full-size ellipse reveals a moderate correlation, whereas a circle indicates no correlation in this way, correlation measures the strength (high, medium or low) of the relationship. Correlation cannot, however, be transformed to a percentage. Thus, a moderate correlation of 0.55 or a high correlation of 0.80 is not equivalent to 55% or 80%, as some people erroneously believe.",

"These situations can be easily analyzed via game theory by including all desires, both to look after ourselves and to help or hurt others, when writing down the payoffs. The payoff numbers in the table represent the total payoff that the players get from each outcome: in a particular outcome a player might benefit directly, as well as indirectly from hurting or helping others. The payoff numbers include everything they care about. Once we write the game in strategic form, each player will only be concerned with increasing their payoffs.",

"1. Ratio scales These differ from interval variables (see here) in two ways: a) an absolute zero indicates the absence of the property being measured (i.e. height, weight and blood pressure) and b) ratio scales are additive.",
"The numerical index that correlation yields also measures the direction of the relationship. Either two variables move up or down the graph together (e.g., height and weight in healthy infants goes up together) or one variable moves up while the other moves down (e.g., the faster one travels in a car, the sooner the destination is reached: speed increases as time decreases). The former produces a positive or direct correlation while the latter yields a negative or inverse correlation.",
"Regression to the Mean This refers to the tendency of a characteristic in a population to move away from the extreme value and closer to the average values.

"Box Muller Transformation Not all programming languages support the generation of random numbers in a normal distribution. You might also be using a custom PRNG not provided by your programming language. There is an algorithm that can transform a continuous random number distribution into a normal one. This algorithm is called the Box Muller Transformation. (Box, 1958)",
"PRNG Concepts There are several important concepts that nearly all PRNGs share. These define how the PRNG performs and what its expected output can be. Common concepts that all PRNGs share include the following: Seed Internal State Period The seed defines the sequence of random numbers you will get, as well as the initial internal state. You should always get the same sequence of random numbers for the same given seed, and nearly every seed should produce a different sequence of random numbers. The internal state comprises the variables that the PRGN uses to produce both the random numbers and the next internal state. If you know the internal state and the type of PRGN or CSPRNG algorithm, you can predict the next random number. The length of each random number sequence is the period. Once the period is up, the random PRGN will repeat. That is why the PRGN is considered a periodic function‚Äîbecause it repeats its values at regular intervals or periods.",
"Equation 3.1: The Euclidean Distance The above equation shows us the Euclidean distance d between two arrays p and q. The above equation also states that d(p,q) is the same as d(q,p). This simply means that the distance is the same no matter which end you start at. Calculation of the Euclidean distance is no more than summing the squares of the difference of each array element. Following this, the square root of this sum is taken. This square root is the Euclidean distance.",

"A deterministic training algorithm always performs exactly the same way, given the same initial state. There are typically no random numbers used in a deterministic training algorithm. Stochastic training makes use of random numbers. Because of this, an algorithm will always train differently, even with the same starting state. This can make it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of a stochastic algorithm. However, stochastic algorithms are very common and very effective.",
"In fact, it is extremely rare to fit the coefficients (or long-term memory vectors) to result in an error that is exactly zero. This is because most data contains noise. Noise is any outcome that is not consistently reproducible given its input data, and thus contributes to a higher error rate. Because of noise, the goal of a machine learning algorithm is usually for the algorithm to perform well on new data, rather than displaying zero error. If you do get a zero error, you should be suspicious that your coefficients are over fit. Over fitting occurs when the machine learning method has memorized your training data. At this point, the algorithm simply recalls memorized input vectors rather than learning to abstract output. An over fit algorithm will not perform well on new data that is not in the original training set.",

"Clustering is the process of placing together observations with similar features, and thereby creating a cluster.",
"The random numbers with the greatest probability are clustered around 0. There is really no defined upper and lower bound. Each whole number represents a standard deviation. As the standard deviations increase on both the positive and negative sides, the probability of getting a random number decreases greatly. Beyond 4 or -4, it is very rare to get a number. Normally distributed random numbers are often useful when you want to vary a number by a small random amount.",

"The three sets that training data is typically divided into are listed here. Training set Validation set Test set The training set is the data with which you train your algorithm. This is usually the largest of three sets. Training data is often selected as 80% of available data. You can then split the remaining 20% between validation and test. It is important to remember that error on your training data is often very optimistic. This is because the training data was used to train the algorithm. If you are evaluating several different algorithms, you should use the validation set next to see what algorithms learned the best. Use data that the algorithms did not see during the training, as the algorithms should be unbiased to this data.",
Clustering is a very useful means of breaking observations into a specified number of groups. Most clustering algorithms require you to specify the number of groups beforehand. Some clustering algorithms can automatically determine an optimal number of groups. This chapter focuses on the K-Means algorithm.,

This means LCG random numbers are not high quality, nor are they suitable for cryptographic applications.",
"When performed by computers, random number generation is called pseudorandom number generation (PRNG). The prefix ‚Äúpseudo‚Äù means that something is implied, rather than defined.

Given exactly the same inputs and internal state, a computer will always produce exactly the same outputs. (Turing, 1948)",
"Chapter Summary This chapter described several normalization processes. Normalization is the process by which data is forced to conform to a specific range. The range is usually either -1 to +1 or 0 to 1. The range you choose is usually dependent on the machine-learning algorithm you are using. This chapter covered several different types of normalization. Reciprocal normalization is a very simple normalization technique. This technique normalizes numbers to the range -1 to 1. Reciprocal normalization simply takes the reciprocal normalization and divides the number to normalize by 1. Range normalization is more complex. However, range normalization allows you to normalize to any range you like. Additionally, range normalization must know the range of the input data. While this does allow you to make use of the entire normalization range, it also means that the entire data set must be analyzed ahead of time.",

By holding a portfolio containing all the stocks in the market, in proportion to their relative size or capitalization (the number of shares outstanding times the price of their shares), the investor would be guaranteed to receive the market return.

To the extent that stocks tend to suffer as interest rates go up, equities are a risky investment, and those stocks that are particularly vulnerable to increases in the general level of interest rates are especially risky. Thus, some stocks and fixed-income investments tend to move in parallel, and these stocks will not be helpful in reducing the risk of a bond portfolio.

Two factors are used in addition to beta to describe risk. The factors derive from their empirical work showing that returns are related to the size of the company (as measured by the market capitalization) and to the relationship of its market price to its book value.

The numerator is the return from the strategy, or more commonly, the excess return over the risk-free rate (usually the three-month Treasury bill rate). The denominator is the risk or volatility of the strategy measured by the standard deviation of the returns (how variable they have been over time).

"Changes in the rate of inflation will similarly tend to have a systematic influence on the returns from common stocks. This is so for at least two reasons. First, an increase in the rate of inflation tends to increase interest rates and thus tends to lower the prices of some equities, as just discussed. Second, the increase in inflation may squeeze profit margins for certain groups of companies‚Äîpublic utilities, for example, which often find that rate increases lag behind increases in costs. On the other hand, inflation may benefit the prices of common stocks in the natural resource industries. Thus, again there are important systematic relationships between stock returns and economic variables that may not be captured adequately by a simple beta measure of risk.",

What most people who use the term have in mind is that it may be possible to gain excess (greater than market) returns by using a variety of relatively passive rules-based investment strategies that involve no more risk than would be assumed by investing in a low-cost total stock market index fund.,
"Behavioral financial economists understand the feedback mechanisms that lead investors to follow the crowd. When Internet stocks were consistently rising, it was hard not to get swept up in the euphoria‚Äîespecially when all your friends were boasting of their spectacular stock-market profits.",
"The actions of individual investors are often irrational, or at least not fully consistent with the economist‚Äôs ideal of optimal decision making. In perhaps the most pathological case, individuals appear to go mad in herds and bid some categories of stocks to unreasonable heights.",
"How easy it was in early 2000, when the tech stock you bought moved persistently higher, to convince yourself that you were an investment genius. How easy it was then to convince yourself that chasing the last period‚Äôs best-performing mutual fund was a sure strategy for success. And for the few who gave up their jobs during the bubble to engage in day-trading, how exhilarating it was to buy a stock at 10:00 a.m. and find that it had risen 10 percent by noon. All of these strategies ended in disaster. Frequent traders invariably earn lower returns than steady buy-and-hold investors.",
"Many behavioralists believe that overconfidence in the ability to predict the future growth of companies leads to a general tendency for so-called growth stocks to be overvalued. If the exciting new computer technology, medical device, or retail outlet catches the public fancy, investors will usually extrapolate success and project high growth rates for the companies involved and hold such beliefs with far more confidence than is justified. The high-growth forecasts lead to higher valuations for growth stocks.",
"In one study, subjects were seated in front of a computer screen divided by a horizontal line, with a ball fluctuating randomly between two halves. The people were given a device to press to move the ball upward, but they were warned that random shocks would also influence the ball so that they did not have complete control. Subjects were then asked to play a game with the object of keeping the ball in the upper half of the screen as long as possible. In one set of experiments, the device was not even attached, so the players had absolutely no control over the movements of the ball. Nevertheless, when subjects were questioned after a period of playing the game, they were convinced that they had a good deal of control over the movement of the ball. (The only subjects not under such an illusion turned out to be those who had been clinically diagnosed with severe depression.)",
"Daniel Kahneman has argued that this tendency to overconfidence is particularly strong among investors. More than most other groups, investors tend to exaggerate their own skill and deny the role of chance. They overestimate their own knowledge, underestimate the risks involved, and exaggerate their ability to control events.",
"In a strict sense, the word ‚Äúarbitrage‚Äù means profiting from prices of the same good that differ in two markets.",
"The Square off Oppositions Aristotle noticed that the truth of some subject-predicate sentences has an effect on the truth of other subject-predicate sentences. Sentences 1 and 2 cannot both be true. The diagonal statements 1 and 4 are known contradictories. As long as there are men, one of them has to be true but never both ‚Äì the truth of one guarantees that the other is false. The same is true for the diagonal statements 2 and 3.",
"Equation 8.1: Cooling Schedule The above equation calculates the temperature for iteration number k. There are a few things to keep in mind when setting the equation. The equation must also be provided with the initial and final temperatures, as well as the max number of iterations. It is not necessary that you use this equation exactly. It is important that the temperature decrease as training progresses. Do not choose zero as the final temperature in the above equation. It is okay to choose something close to zero, however. Because the above equation multiplies by the final temperature, having a final temperature of zero will quickly take the current temperature to zero. You can see this cooling schedule in Figure 8.2. Figure 8.2: Cooling from 1,000 to 10,500 Iterations The temperature is used to determine the probability that the algorithm will accept an inferior score.",
"Aside from the long-term positive direction of the stock market, streaks of excessively high stock returns do not persist‚Äîthey are typically followed by lower future returns. There is reversion to the mean. Similarly, the laws of financial gravity also operate in reverse. At least for the stock market as a whole, what goes down eventually comes back up. Yet each era‚Äôs conventional wisdom typically assumes that unusually good markets will get better and unusually bad markets will get worse.",
People are prone to attribute any good outcome to their own abilities. They tend to rationalize bad outcomes as resulting from unusual external events.,
"This is what psychologists mean by overconfidence. If an investor tells you he is 99 percent sure, he would be better off assuming that he was only 80 percent sure. Such precision implies that people tend to put larger stakes on their predictions than are justified. And men typically display far more overconfidence than women, especially about their prowess in money matters.",
THE FAMA-FRENCH RISK FACTORS ‚Ä¢ Beta: from the Capital-Asset Pricing Model ‚Ä¢ Size: measured by total equity market capitalization ‚Ä¢ Value: measured by the ratio of market to book value,
Rate of Return = Risk-free Rate + Beta (Return from Market ‚Äì Risk-free Rate).,
"It turns out that the portfolio with the least risk had 18 percent foreign securities and 82 percent U.S. securities. Moreover, adding 18 percent EAFE stocks to a domestic portfolio also tended to increase the portfolio return. International diversification provided the closest thing to a free lunch available in our world securities markets.",
"Thus, purchasing a fund holding all the stocks in a broad-based index will produce a portfolio that can be expected to do as well as any managed by professional security analysts.",
A firm‚Äôs income statement may be likened to a bikini‚Äîwhat it reveals is interesting but what it conceals is vital.,
"One of Bridgewater‚Äôs greatest successes had been the development of ‚Äúrisk parity‚Äù investment techniques. The evidence-based principle on which it rests is that relatively safe assets often provide higher returns than are appropriate for their level of risk, while riskier assets are relatively overpriced and return less than they should. Investors can therefore improve their results by leveraging low-risk assets, buying them with some borrowed money, so as to increase their risk and return,",
One of the most important lessons of behavioral finance is that individual investors must avoid being carried away by herd behavior.,
"The subjects were shown two cards with vertical lines such as the cards shown below. The card on the left showed one vertical line. The subjects were asked which line on the card on the right was the same length as the line on the first card. Seven subjects participated in a series of such questions. But Asch added a diabolical twist to the experiment. In some of the experiments, he recruited six of the seven participants to deliberately give the wrong answer and to do so before the seventh participant had a chance to express an opinion. The results were astonishing. The seventh participant would often give the incorrect answer. Asch conjectured that social pressure caused participants to pick the wrong line even when they knew that their answer was incorrect.",
Overoptimism in forecasting the growth for exciting companies could then be one explanation for the tendency of ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù stocks to underperform ‚Äúvalue‚Äù stocks.,
"First and foremost, many individual investors are mistakenly convinced that they can beat the market. As a result, they speculate more than they should and trade too much.",
"Basically, there are four factors that create irrational market behavior: overconfidence, biased judgments, herd mentality, and loss aversion.",
"The stock market appears to be an efficient mechanism that adjusts quite quickly to new information. Neither technical analysis, which analyzes the past price movements of stocks, nor fundamental analysis, which analyzes more basic information about the prospects for individual companies and the economy, seems to yield consistent benefits. It appears that the only way to obtain higher long-run investment returns is to accept greater risks.",
"Depending on exactly how you measure the ‚Äúmarket,‚Äù you can obtain very different beta values. One‚Äôs conclusions about the capital-asset pricing model and beta as a measure of risk depend very much on how you measure beta.",
"We go on to say that part of total risk or variability may be called the security‚Äôs systematic risk and that this arises from the basic variability of stock prices in general and the tendency for all stocks to go along with the general market, at least to some extent. The remaining variability in a stock‚Äôs returns is called unsystematic risk and results from factors peculiar to that particular company‚Äîfor example, a strike, the discovery of a new product, and so on.",
‚ÄúWe can reasonably describe the total risk of any security (or portfolio) as the total variability (variance or standard deviation) of the returns from the security‚Äù?,
"Also, changes in national income mirror changes in the personal income of individuals, and the systematic relationship between security returns and salary income can be expected to have a significant effect on individual behavior. For example, the laborer in a Ford plant will find that holding Ford common stock is particularly risky, because job layoffs and poor returns from Ford stock are likely to occur at the same time.",
"Finally, investors should be aware that even if the long-run relationship between beta and return is flat, beta can still be a useful investment management tool. Were it in fact the case that low-beta stocks will dependably earn rates of return at least as large as those of high-beta stocks (a very big ‚Äúif‚Äù indeed), then beta would be even more valuable as an investment tool than if the capital-asset pricing model held. Investors should scoop up low-beta stocks and earn returns as attractive as for the market as a whole but with much less risk. And investors who do wish to seek higher returns by assuming greater risk should buy and hold low-beta stocks on margin, thereby increasing their risk and returns.",
"What is clear, however, is that beta, as usually measured, is not a substitute for brains and is not a reliable predictor of long-run future returns.",
Rate of Return ‚Äì Risk-free Rate = Beta (Return from Market ‚Äì Risk-free Rate).,
"The calculation begins by assigning a beta of 1 to a broad market index. If a stock has a beta of 2, then on average it swings twice as far as the market. If the market goes up 10 percent, the stock tends to rise 20 percent. If a stock has a beta of 0.5, it tends to go up or down 5 percent when the market rises or declines 10 percent.",
"Risk, and risk alone, determines the degree to which returns will be above or below average.",
Any successful technical scheme must ultimately be self-defeating.,
"The point is, however, that the probability of making a shot is independent of the outcome of previous shots. The psychologists conjecture that the persistent belief in the hot hand could be due to memory bias. If long sequences of hits or misses are more memorable than alternating sequences, observers are likely to overestimate the correlation between successive shots. When events sometimes do come in clusters and streaks, people refuse to believe that they are random, even though such clusters and streaks do occur frequently in random data such as are derived from the tossing of a coin.",
"it, ‚ÄúWorldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.‚Äù",
Rule 2: Never pay more for a stock than its firm foundation of value.,
Determinant 3: The degree of risk.,
"The algebra is simple. Your $100 grows to $110 at the end of year one. Next year, you also earn 10 percent on the $110 you start with, so you have $121 at the end of year two. Thus, the total return over the two-year period is 21 percent. The reason it works is that the interest you earn from your original investment also earns interest. Carrying it out in year three, you have $133.10. Compounding is powerful indeed.",
"But not all of the risk of individual securities is relevant in determining the premium for bearing risk. The unsystematic part of the total risk is easily eliminated by adequate diversification. So there is no reason to think that investors will receive extra compensation for bearing unsystematic risk. The only part of total risk that investors will get paid for bearing is systematic risk, the risk that diversification cannot help. Thus, the capital-asset pricing model says that returns (and, therefore, risk premiums) for any stock (or portfolio) will be related to beta, the systematic risk that cannot be diversified away.",
"Once academics accepted the idea that risk for investors is related to the chance of disappointment in achieving expected security returns, a natural measure suggested itself‚Äîthe probable dispersion of future returns. Thus, financial risk has generally been defined as the variance or standard deviation of returns.",
Simply buying and holding the stocks in a broad market index is a strategy that is very hard for the professional portfolio manager to beat.,
‚ÄúHe who looks back at the predictions of market gurus dies of remorse.‚Äù,
"Despite its plausibility and scientific appearance, there are three potential flaws in this type of analysis. First, the information and analysis may be incorrect.

Corollary to Rule 1: A rational investor should be willing to pay a higher price for a share the longer an extraordinary growth rate is expected to last.,
Albert Einstein once described compound interest as the ‚Äúgreatest mathematical discovery of all time.‚Äù,
"There are many logical arguments against charting. First, the chartist buys only after price trends have been established, and sells only after they have been broken. Because sharp reversals in the market may occur quite suddenly, the chartist often misses the boat. By the time an uptrend is signaled, it may already have taken place. Second, such techniques must ultimately be self-defeating. As more and more people use it, the value of any technique depreciates. No buy or sell signal can be worthwhile if everyone tries to act on it simultaneously.",
"Third, investors often underreact initially to new information. There is some evidence that when earnings are announced that beat (trail) Wall Street estimates (positive or negative ‚Äúearnings surprises‚Äù), the stock price reacts positively (negatively), but the initial adjustment is incomplete. Thus, the stock market will often adjust to earnings information only gradually, resulting in a sustained period of price momentum.",
It is the extreme volatility in the value of the bitcoin that makes it fail the second and third common definitions of money. An asset that gains and loses a substantial percentage of its initial value each day will serve neither as a useful unit of account nor as a dependable store of value. It is in this volatility that the peril of the bitcoin resides. There is no natural anchor for the value of a cryptocurrency.,
"Systematic risk, also called market risk, captures the reaction of individual stocks (or portfolios) to general market swings. Some stocks and portfolios tend to be very sensitive to market movements. Others are more stable. This relative volatility or sensitivity to market moves can be estimated on the basis of the past record, and is popularly known by‚Äîyou guessed it‚Äîthe Greek letter beta.",
"There is a nasty secret in the mutual-fund industry that if you have a poorly performing fund, it does not reflect well on the mutual-fund complex. So the poorly performing funds tend to get merged into funds with better records, thereby killing off their embarrassing records.",
"There are, I believe, five factors that help explain why security analysts have such difficulty in predicting the future. These are (1) the influence of random events, (2) the production of dubious reported earnings through ‚Äúcreative‚Äù accounting procedures, (3) errors made by the analysts themselves, (4) the loss of the best analysts to the sales desk or to portfolio management, and (5) the conflicts of interest facing securities analysts at firms with large investment banking operations.",
"The results of the Super Bowl indicator simply illustrate nothing more than the fact that it‚Äôs sometimes possible to correlate two completely unrelated events. Indeed, Mark Hulbert reports that the stock-market researcher David Leinweber found that the indicator most closely correlated with the S&P 500 Index is the volume of butter production in Bangladesh.",
"Look for growth situations with low price-earnings multiples. If the growth takes place, there‚Äôs often a double bonus‚Äîboth the earnings and the multiple rise, producing large gains. Beware of very high multiple stocks in which future growth is already discounted. If growth doesn‚Äôt materialize, losses are doubly heavy‚Äîboth the earnings and the multiples drop.",
"The final problem is that, even with correct information and value estimates, the stock you buy might still go down.",
"There is always some combination of growth rate and growth period that will produce any specific price. It is intrinsically impossible to calculate the intrinsic value of a share. There is, I believe, a fundamental indeterminateness about the value of common shares even in principle.",

Perhaps the major advantage of using bitcoin as a currency for transactions and as a store of value is its anonymous nature.,
There is no evidence that anyone can generate excess returns by making consistently correct bets against the collective wisdom of the market. Markets are not always or even usually correct. But NO ONE PERSON OR INSTITUTION CONSISTENTLY KNOWS MORE THAN THE MARKET.,
"The paradoxical result of this analysis is that overall portfolio risk is reduced by the addition of a small amount of riskier foreign securities. Good returns from Japanese automakers balanced out poor returns from domestic ones when the Japanese share of the U.S. market increased. On the other hand, good returns from U.S. manufacturers offset poor returns from foreign manufacturers when the dollar became more competitive and Japan and Europe remained in a recession as the U.S. economy boomed. It is precisely these offsetting movements that reduced the overall volatility of the portfolio.",
"Do you think you should ‚ÄúSell in May and Go Away‚Äù until October? In fact, the market rises between May and October more often than not.",
Rule 1: Buy only companies that are expected to have above-average earnings growth for five or more years.,
"Lynch calculated each potential stock‚Äôs P/E-to-growth ratio (or PEG ratio) and would buy for his portfolio only those stocks with high growth relative to their P/Es. This was not simply a low P/E strategy, because a stock with a 50 percent growth rate and a P/E of 25 (PEG ratio of ¬Ω) was deemed far better than a stock with 20 percent growth and a P/E of 20 (PEG ratio of 1). If one is correct in one‚Äôs growth projections, and for a while Lynch was, this strategy can produce excellent returns.",
"guide. Suppose you were considering the purchase of a stock with an anticipated 5 percent growth rate and you knew that, on average, stocks with 5 percent growth sold, like Merck, at 13 times earnings. If the stock you were considering sold at a price-earnings multiple of 20, you might reject the idea of buying the stock in favor of one more reasonably priced in terms of current market norms.",
"The nonsense of relying on very high long-term growth rates is nicely illustrated by working with population projections for the United States. If the populations of the nation and of California continue to grow at their recent rates, 120 percent of the United States population will live in California by the year 2045!",
"And even if the natural life cycle doesn‚Äôt get a company, there‚Äôs always the fact that it gets harder and harder to grow at the same percentage rate. A company earning $1 million need increase its earnings by only $100,000 to achieve a 10 percent growth rate, whereas a company starting from a base of $10 million in earnings needs $1 million in additional earnings to produce the same record.",
"It is often said that the Native American who sold Manhattan Island in 1626 for $24 was rooked by the white man. In fact, he may have been an extremely sharp salesman. Had he put his $24 away at 6 percent interest, compounded semiannually, it would now be worth more than $100 billion, and with it his descendants could buy back much of the now improved land. Such is the magic of compound growth!",
"completed with the use of bitcoin. If you lived in North Korea or Venezuela or you were a drug dealer, bitcoin, rather than the U.S. dollar, was the preferred currency of choice.

The fundamentalist uses four basic determinants to help estimate the proper value for any stock.,
"Second, there may be unequal access to fundamental information about a company. When some favorable piece of news occurs, such as the discovery of a rich mineral deposit, it is alleged that the insiders are the first to know, and they act, buying the stock and causing its price to rise. The insiders then tell their friends, who act next. Then the professionals find out the news, and the big institutions put blocks of the shares in their portfolios.",
"As a bonus, the transaction did not show up on the buyer‚Äôs credit card bill.",
"Fundamental analysts take the opposite tack, believing that the market is 90 percent logical and only 10 percent psychological. Caring little about the particular pattern of past price movements, fundamentalists seek to determine a stock‚Äôs proper value. Value in this case is related to a company‚Äôs assets, its expected growth rate of earnings and dividends, interest rates, and risk.",
"Markets can be highly efficient even if they make errors. Some are doozies, as when Internet stocks in the early 2000s appeared to discount not only the future but the hereafter.",
No accurate history of the housing bubble can fail to recognize that it was not simply ‚Äúpredatory lenders‚Äù but the government itself that caused many mortgage loans to be made to people who did not have the wherewithal to service them.,
Bubbles are particularly dangerous when they are associated with a credit boom and widespread increases in leverage both for consumers and for financial institutions.,
"‚ÄúMind share‚Äù was another popular nonfinancial metric that convinced me that investors had lost their collective minds. For example, the online home seller Homestore.com was highly recommended in October 2000 by Morgan Stanley because 72 percent of all the time spent by Internet users on real estate websites was spent on properties listed by Homestore.com. But ‚Äúmind share‚Äù did not lead Internet users to make up their minds to buy the properties listed and did not prevent Homestore.com from falling 99 percent from its high during 2001.",

Many in Wall Street refuse to accept the fact that no reliable pattern can be discerned from past records to aid the analyst in predicting future growth.,
"Individual and institutional investors are not computers that calculate warranted price-earnings multiples and print out buy and sell decisions.

Determinant 4: The level of market interest rates.,
"In estimating the firm-foundation value of a stock, the fundamentalist‚Äôs most important job is to estimate the firm‚Äôs future stream of earnings and dividends.

"There are important advantages to buying growth stocks at very reasonable earnings multiples. If your growth estimate turns out to be correct, you may get the double bonus I mentioned in connection with Rule 1: The price will tend to go up simply because the earnings went up, but also the multiple is likely to expand. Hence, the double bonus. Suppose, for example, you buy a stock earning $1 per share and selling at $7.50. If the earnings grow to $2 per share and if the price-earnings multiple increases from 7¬Ω to 15 (in recognition that the company now can be considered a growth stock), you don‚Äôt just double your money‚Äîyou quadruple it.

"And so performance investing took hold of Wall Street in the late 1960s. Because near-term performance was especially important (investment services began to publish monthly records of mutual-fund performance), it was best to buy stocks with an exciting concept and a compelling and believable story that the market would recognize now‚Äînot far into the future. Hence, the birth of the so-called concept stock. But even if the story was not totally believable, as long as the investment manager was convinced that the average opinion would think that the average opinion would believe the story, that‚Äôs all that was needed.

Second, the government and the accounting profession expressed concern about the pace of mergers and about possible abuses. These two worries reduced‚Äîand in many cases eliminated‚Äîthe premium multiples that had been paid in anticipation of earnings growth from the acquisition process alone.

An interesting footnote to this episode is that during the first two decades of the 2000s deconglomeration came into fashion.

An option on a tulip bulb currently worth 100 guilders, for example, would cost the buyer only about 20 guilders. If the price moved up to 200 guilders, the option holder would exercise his right; he would buy at 100 and simultaneously sell at the then current price of 200.

"Estimating bond returns becomes murky when bonds are not held until maturity. Changes in interest rates (bond yields) then become a major factor in determining the net return received over the period during which the bond is held. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall so as to make existing bonds competitive with those that are currently being issued at the higher interest rates. When rates fall, bond prices increase. The principle to keep in mind is that bond investors who don‚Äôt hold to maturity will suffer to the extent that interest rates rise and gain to the extent that rates fall.",

"The core of every portfolio should consist of low-cost, tax-efficient, broad-based index funds.",
"If you buy bonds directly (rather than indirectly through mutual funds), I suggest that you buy new issues rather than already outstanding securities. New-issue yields are usually a bit sweeter than the yields of seasoned outstanding bonds, and you avoid paying transactions charges on new issues. I think you should keep your risk within reasonable bounds by sticking with issues rated at least A by Moody‚Äôs and Standard & Poor‚Äôs rating services. Also consider so-called AMT bonds. These bonds are subject to the alternative minimum (income) tax and, therefore, are not attractive to individuals who have sheltered a significant part of their income from tax. But if you are not subject to the alternative minimum tax, you can get some extra yield from holding AMT bonds.",
"TIPS do have a nasty tax feature, however, that limits their usefulness. Taxes on TIPS returns are due on both the coupon payment and the increase in principal amount reflecting inflation. The problem is that the Treasury does not pay out the increase in principal until maturity. If inflation were high enough, the small coupon payments might be insufficient to pay the taxes and the imbalance would worsen at higher rates of inflation. Thus, TIPS are far from ideal for taxable investors and are best used only in tax-advantaged retirement plans.",
There is much about investing you cannot control. You can‚Äôt do anything about the ups and downs of the stock and bond markets. But you can control your investment costs.

"All men suffer, now as well as in ancient times, but not all are unhappy, for unhappiness is a reaction to suffering, not suffering itself. Therefore, generally speaking, the primitive was unhappy from his conflict with the external forces of nature. But the unhappiness of civilized man is chiefly the result of conflict with natural forces inside himself and inside human society, forces that are all the more dangerous and violent because they come in unrecognized and unwanted at the back door.",
"religious ideas and practices (which are no more religion itself than any other activities) exist solely to promote a positive and loving attitude toward ordinary life and what it stands for, namely, God. Unless one happens to be a religious specialist, which is not necessarily the same thing as a spiritual person, religious practices are not ends in themselves. They are means to a fuller and greater life in this world, involving a positive and constructive attitude to pleasure and pain alike, and thus an increasing ability to learn happiness and freedom from every possible kind of experience.",
"When it is said that man will not let himself be saved as he is, this is another way of saying that he will not accept himself as he is; subtly he gets around this simple act by making a technique out of acceptance, setting it up as something which he should do in order to be a ‚Äúgood boy.‚Äù And as soon as acceptance is made a question of doing and technique we have the vicious circle.

"The spiritual genius works in the same way as the musical genius. He has a wider scope because his technique of expression, his alphabet, is every possible human activity. For some reason there arises in his soul a feeling of the most profound happiness, not because of some special event, but because of the whole of life. This is not necessarily contentment or joy; it is rather that he feels himself completely united to the power that moves the universe, whatever that may be. This feeling he expresses in two ways, firstly by living a certain kind of life, and secondly by translating his feeling into the form of thoughts and words.

"But this kind of religion does not encourage the type of love upon which spirituality is founded. We have seen that its technique is imitative and thus unlikely to produce genuine, firsthand religious experience; we have also seen that its contempt of this world and its concentration on the life hereafter has little to do with the essentials of religion. This is not all, for not only has it little to do with such essentials; it is also a decided hindrance to spiritual growth because it encourages a ‚Äúlove‚Äù of God on a false basis. God is loved not because He has given us this world, but because He is said to have promised a much better world in the life after death.",
"Love, however, is not to be confused with liking; we may love the opposites, but because of our human nature we cannot always like them. Only the pervert actually likes suffering, but the love of suffering is known in giving freedom to your dislike of it; for without dislike on our part, suffering is no longer suffering.",
"That is the only promise which can be given for faith, but what a promise! It means that we share in the ecstasy of His creation and His destruction, and experience the mystery and the freedom of His power in all the aspects of life, in both the heights of pleasure and the depths of pain. It may seem illogical, but those who have once shared in this mystery have a gratitude that knows no bounds and are able to say again that God is Love, though with an altogether new meaning.",
"To return to our analogy: life is the current into which man is thrown, and though he struggles against it, it carries him along despite all his efforts, with the result that his efforts achieve nothing but his own unhappiness.",
"Wisdom is a quality of the psychological or spiritual relationship between man and his experience. When that relationship is wise and harmonious man‚Äôs experiences set him free, but when it is unwise and discordant his experiences bind him. Religion alone can deal with that relationship, and this is its essential function.",
"An earlier myth than that of St. Michael and the Dragon tells of an encounter with a monster who for every one head slashed off by the hero‚Äôs sword grew seven new heads. Indeed, the problem of evil is not quite so straightforward as the accepted technique of ‚Äúmorality by battle‚Äù would assume. Those desires, feelings, and impulses in the soul which are called evil seem to thrive on resistance because resistance belongs to their own nature, and, as the Buddha said, ‚ÄúHatred ceases not by hatred alone; hatred ceases but by love.‚Äù This seems reasonable enough when applied to persons, but somehow we find it difficult to believe that the impulse of hate can only be overcome by loving it. But, as with fear, the hate of hatred is only adding one hate to another, and its results are as contrary as those of the war which was fought to end war.",
"There is not that joyous response of the individual to the universe which is the essence of spirituality, which expresses itself in religious worship and adoration.",
"Since 1900, we have more than doubled our life expectancy. In 1900, the average life span was just thirty-three years; today it is more than seventy-one.",

"But something amazing started happening in the 1970s: mostly because of global warming, we started getting more green vegetation. And this will continue over the century as we continue to emit more fertilizing carbon dioxide. Indeed, if we follow a standard worst-case scenario for carbon dioxide emissions to the end of the century, we could end up with almost 50 percent more green mass in the world by 2100. By one estimate, we would be above the amount of green the world had in 1500, before we started the widespread reduction in global vegetation.",
"Billions are being spent, too, on exploring technologies like more aerodynamic wings, advanced and lighter plane structures, more efficient engines, and new aircraft configurations. And the International Air Transport Association, which represents airlines, estimates that better route management could cut CO2 emissions by 10 percent.",
"Overall, fossil fuels have declined only slightly as a share of German energy. In the first decade of the new millennium, the fossil fuel share of the overall energy supply dropped somewhat from 84 to 80 percent. But in the years since the Energiewende was passed in 2010, the fossil fuel share has stayed almost constant, inching down just one percentage point to 79 percent today.21",
"Many climate campaigners go further than the science supports. They implicitly or even explicitly suggest that exaggeration is acceptable because the cause is so important. After a 2019 UN climate science report led to over-the-top claims by activists, one of the scientist authors warned against exaggeration. He wrote: ‚ÄúWe risk turning off the public with extremist talk that is not carefully supported by the science.‚Äù",
Psychodynamic experiences are particularly common in psycholytic therapy of psychiatric patients and in unsupervised LSD sessions of individuals who have considerable emotional problems.,
"If anyone imagines Buddhism to be a religion of pure passivity, as we understand it, he should see some of the Chinese paintings of Achala! He might also do well to visit some of the living masters of Zen Buddhism. For the art of becoming reconciled to and at ease with those aspects of natural man which correspond to storm and thunder in the natural universe is to let them rage. Just as there is an incomparable beauty and majesty in thunder and lightning, so also there is something awe-inspiring in the abandoned and uninhibited anger of the sage, which is no mere loss of temper or petty irritability.",
"There is also the problem of the relation between nature and the ego. If we accept the universe and subordinate ourselves to it, if, instead of trying to live life, we let life live us, we are accepting one aspect of life only to deny another‚Äîthe aggressive, self-asserting ego in which life has manifested itself.",
"In his influential book The Uninhabitable Earth, journalist David Wallace-Wells states that coastal flooding caused by sea level rise will result in somewhere between $14 trillion and more than $100 trillion of damages every year by 2100. This idea has been repeated by countless climate activists. But it turns out that these figures exaggerate the problem by up to two thousand times.31",
"So if you‚Äôre living in a rich country, going entirely vegetarian for the rest of your life will reduce your total personal emissions by about 2 percent.",
"But global warming will incur real costs and reductions to agriculture. Unlike almost any other sector, agriculture is acutely vulnerable to changes in weather, because most of it will always have to take place outdoors. As rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns impact future agriculture, the increases in food production will be smaller than they could have been.",
"In the United Kingdom and the United States, two of the most prosperous countries on the planet, an astonishing 65 percent of people are pessimistic about the future. A 2019 poll found that almost half of the world‚Äôs population believes climate change likely will end the human race. In the United States, four of ten people believe global warming will lead to mankind‚Äôs extinction.",
"Similarly, when we talk about human welfare, what we mean can run the gamut from the level of starvation and deaths in society, to access to education and economic opportunities, to the level of happiness and general life satisfaction. GDP does not perfectly encapsulate every one of these aspects of human welfare, but it turns out to be the single measure that more strongly than anything else relates to most of these impacts.",
"The full study concludes that the total average global cost will be 0.26 percent of GDP by the end of the century. While we still will end up producing much more food for the world, global warming will mean we have to produce it with more effort and with more trade, overall leaving us less well off, at about a quarter of a percent of global GDP.",
"Today, residential electricity costs in the EU are twice the US cost of 13¬¢ per kWh. This gap will grow quickly. Over the next decade, one 2019 study estimates that mostly because of stronger climate policies, the wholesale electricity price in the EU will quadruple.24",
"The motivating power of the vicious circle is pride. In Christian terms we should say that man is not willing to be saved as he is; he feels that it is necessary for him to do something about it, to earn salvation by his own self-made spirituality and righteousness. The Grace of God is offered freely to all, but through pride man will not accept it. He cannot bear the thought that he is absolutely powerless to lift himself up and that the only chance of salvation is simply to accept something which is offered as freely to the saint as to the sinner.",
"The science shows us that fears of a climate apocalypse are unfounded. Global warming is real, but it is not the end of the world. It is a manageable problem.",
"But in any real-life scenario, over the next eighty years farmers, their children, and grandchildren will start to tinker with earlier sowing, adapt to different wheat varieties, and might eventually switch entirely to crops that fare better in hotter weather.",
"The researchers estimate the worst-case cost of this complete collapse at $301 billion by 2200. With middle-of-the-road estimates of economic growth, this translates into a loss of 0.0075 percent of global GDP by then.",
"The biggest environmental killer, outdoor air pollution, initially increases as incomes go up, but then it starts declining as individuals become even richer. Put simply, when immediate concerns like hunger and infectious diseases are tackled, people start demanding more environmental regulations.11",
"Economists have tried to estimate the impact of acidification by exploring what would happen in a worst-case scenario. Here they model a complete collapse of fishing of wild fish from the oceans, both for commercial, recreational, and subsistence fishermen by 2020. Moreover, they imagine a complete loss of tourism and recreation from coral reefs.18",
"The problem with research on the climate consequences of having children is that it‚Äôs based on a deeply bizarre way of measuring these consequences. The most cited research paper, published in 2009, measures the climate impact of children by holding each parent responsible for half of every child‚Äôs projected emissions over the entire duration of the child‚Äôs life. Fine so far. But they do not stop there. A parent is held responsible not just for half of their child‚Äôs emissions, but also for a quarter of their grandchildren‚Äôs emissions, an eighth of their great-grandchildren‚Äôs emissions, and so on. Moreover, the researchers estimate that each of these future children will emit twenty tons of carbon dioxide every year throughout their lives.",

"The agreement‚Äôs preamble even spoke of limiting temperature rises to less than 2¬∞C (3.6¬∞F), or even 1.5¬∞C (2.7¬∞F). French president Fran√ßois Hollande said: ‚ÄúThis is a major leap for mankind.‚Äù Economist Lord Stern added: ‚ÄúThis is a historic moment, not just for us but for our children, our grandchildren and future generations.‚Äù Al Gore saw it as ‚Äúbold and historic.‚Äù1",
"Analysis by experts shows that we are likely to become much, much better off in the future. Researchers working for the UN suggest that by 2100 average incomes will increase perhaps to 450 percent of today‚Äôs incomes. Life expectancy will continue to increase, to eighty-two years or possibly beyond a hundred years.",
"The concept of climate change includes not just temperature rises but all sorts of other changes, from droughts and floods to storms and reductions in crop performance, from heat-related deaths to rising sea levels. But the summary measure for all these impacts and for climate science in general is the change in global temperature.",
"Top climate economists agree that the best way to combat its negative effects is to invest in green innovation. We should be innovating tomorrow‚Äôs technologies rather than erecting today‚Äôs inefficient turbines and solar panels. We should explore fusion, fission, water splitting, and more. We can research algae grown on the ocean surface that produces oil. Because the algae converts sunlight and carbon dioxide to oil, burning that oil will not release any new carbon dioxide. Oil algae are far from cost effective now, but researching this and many other solutions is not only cheap but also offers our best opportunity to find real breakthrough technologies.26",
"Another serious concern often raised is ocean acidification. The cost of ocean acidification is not included in any of the computer models that create estimates of the costs of global warming. The basic problem comes from the earth‚Äôs oceans taking up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, making them more acidic. Acidification hurts marine organisms that build their shells and skeletons from calcium carbonate.",
The UN estimates that the additional infrastructure cost alone of achieving the 2.7¬∞F (1.5¬∞C) limit would come to almost a trillion dollars each and every year for the next thirty years.,
"Evidence shows that globally we are now spending more than $400 billion annually on climate change, through investments in renewables, in subsidies, and in lost growth.18 The costs are likely to keep increasing. With 194 signatories, the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, the most expensive pact in human history, is likely to incur costs of some $1‚Äì$2 trillion per year by 2030.",
"A 2017 study found that where humans are present, climate is less important in determining fire activity. It found that significant human presence‚Äîsuch as closeness to towns and roads, the number of people living in an area, and the amount of land developed‚Äîcan ‚Äúoverride, or swamp out, the effect of climate.‚Äù",
"Instead of telling people not to fly on airplanes, we should focus on the carbon efficiency of those airplanes. Adaptation is already occurring: each new generation of aircraft is on average 20 percent more fuel efficient than the model it replaces.",
"Carbon dioxide gas leads to global warming because it lets in the sun‚Äôs heat but blocks some of the earth‚Äôs heat from escaping and therefore, a bit like a greenhouse, warms us up. What matters for the earth‚Äôs temperature is the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Each year‚Äôs emissions add to the total amount, although the world‚Äôs oceans and forests suck out the equivalent of about half of these new emissions. So, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere keeps going up: since 1750, the total amount has increased by 40 percent.",
This is a well-known phenomenon called the ‚Äúexpanding bull‚Äôs-eye effect‚Äù: similar climate impacts will result in much more costly disasters because an increasing number of people with more and more valuable assets are at risk.,
"In 2006, Al Gore estimated that unless drastic measures to reduce greenhouse gases were taken within ten years, the world would reach a point of no return.",
"The World Wildlife Fund Living Planet Report, published in 2018, finds that exploitation (e.g., overfishing) and habitat loss (converting nature into farms and cities) are responsible for about 70 to 80 percent of all threats to species. When we look at what influences species extinction, climate change is one of the smallest factors: 5 to 12 percent.",
"ONE OF THE great ironies of climate change activism today is that many of the movement‚Äôs most vocal proponents are also horrified by global income inequality. They are blind, however, to the fact that the costs of the policies they demand will be borne disproportionately by the world‚Äôs poorest. This is because so much of climate change policy boils down to limiting access to cheap energy.",
"We will see that even if we went all-in and spent hundreds of trillions on climate policies, sea levels would still rise, only slightly less than if we did nothing. Millions would still get flooded. If we instead went all-in on adaptation, we could for less than a hundredth of the cost save almost everyone. The same with heat deaths; focusing on climate policies costs vastly more yet helps much, much less than air conditioning.",
"Tackling global warming means limiting the rise in global temperature, or even trying to reverse that rise. This means cutting carbon dioxide emissions dramatically, and as we saw, even stopping the entire rich world‚Äôs emissions of carbon dioxide will not be nearly enough. And this will mean giving up the cheapest and most reliable energy sources, which will slow GDP growth at significant cost to human welfare.",
"One possible catastrophe that people often bring up is the complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet. If it happened within a lifetime, that would be catastrophic. However, the UN climate panel finds that even with a very large amount of heat, it will take a millennium or more to melt all of Greenland‚Äôs ice. Studies indicate that even in the absence of climate policy, 60 to 70 percent of the Greenland ice sheet would be around in a thousand years.",
"The Energiewende has cost $36 billion annually in recent years, and is the country‚Äôs biggest political project since reunification. Electricity costs have doubled over the past two decades and are now at 35¬¢ per kWh, almost three times the US average. Germans will have spent $580 billion on renewables and related infrastructure by 2025.",
"In the case of carbon dioxide, the best research on costs and benefits shows that we should cut some, but by no means all, carbon dioxide emissions. We should do so through a carbon tax, starting out rather low at $20 per ton of emissions (equivalent to an 18¬¢ per gallon tax on gasoline) and slowly increasing it over the century. The tax should preferably be coordinated globally, but more likely we‚Äôll end up with a patchwork of less effective policies. Still, this will cut the global temperature rise somewhat and prevent us from reaching the most damaging temperatures. It will also slightly slow economic growth, because that is the inevitable corollary of making energy more expensive.",
"Even if every single one of the 4.5 billion people getting on any flight this year stayed on the ground, and the same happened every year until 2100, the rise in temperatures would be reduced by just 0.05¬∞F, equivalent to delaying climate change by less than one year by 2100.30",
"So climate change will make future hurricanes more damaging (0.02 percent instead of 0.01 percent), but because the world is getting much richer, and thus more resilient and prepared for disaster, hurricanes will have a lower overall cost as a percentage of GDP in 2100 than they do today. For the future, what matters most is that we make sure that the most vulnerable, worst-off people living in shantytowns like the Mudd are lifted out of poverty. It is growth, not carbon dioxide reductions, that will prevent the harrowing losses that the world‚Äôs poorest endure as a result of hurricanes.",
"The best current research shows that the cost of climate change by the end of the century, if we do nothing, will be around 3.6 percent of global GDP. This includes all the negative impacts; not just the increased costs from stronger storms, but also the costs of increased deaths from heat waves and the lost wetlands from rising sea levels. This means that instead of seeing incomes rise to 450 percent by 2100, they might increase ‚Äúonly‚Äù to 434 percent. That‚Äôs clearly a",
"Studies show that as societies see greater threats, they increase the height and number of protective dikes to reduce these threats. And the evidence also clearly shows that adaptation increases with higher incomes. This makes sense: at the same level of threat, richer countries can afford to demand higher dikes and more protection than poorer countries.",
The models show that each dollar invested in green energy research and development (R&D) will avoid $11 of climate damage. This will be hundreds of times more effective than current climate policies.,
"But in their last major global-level report, the UN‚Äôs climate scientists didn‚Äôt find that to be true. They said, ‚ÄúThere is low confidence in a global-scale observed trend in drought.‚Äù They found that since 1950 drought had likely increased in the Mediterranean and West Africa, but had likely decreased in central North America and northwest Australia. In other words, on a planetary level, the earth isn‚Äôt experiencing more drought.",
Eventually I settled on a formulation that involves two kinds of utility: acquisition utility and transaction utility. Acquisition utility is based on standard economic theory and is equivalent to what economists call ‚Äúconsumer surplus.‚Äù,
"We should focus on the temperature rise of just above 7¬∞F, because that is likely to be what we will see at the end of the century, without any additional climate policies beyond those to which governments have already committed. At 7.2¬∞F in 2100, climate change would cause negative impacts equivalent to a 2.9 percent loss to global GDP.",

"Trying to save the world by giving up meat or unplugging our cell phones is ultimately misguided, and it distracts us from doing things that could make a real difference. If we want to improve the carbon efficiency of our food supply, one obvious approach would be to spend more on research and development for artificial meat. If this could be as good as the real stuff (some would say we‚Äôre already there) there are huge opportunities to cut emissions. Artificial meat generates up to 96 percent fewer greenhouse gases than conventionally produced meat.",
"Researchers find that global greening over the past thirty-five years has increased leaves on plants and trees equivalent in area to two times the continental United States. It is equivalent to greening the entire continent of Australia with plants or trees, two times over. It is quite remarkable that over a few decades we got the equivalent of two entire new continents of green because of carbon dioxide‚Äîand virtually nobody has heard about it.",
"Not only does each unit of energy emit ever more carbon dioxide, but the world also uses more and more energy. As a result, total carbon emissions keep rising. Since 1992, humanity has emitted more carbon dioxide than in all history before then. Emissions will likely keep increasing in the coming decades, as more poor countries clamber out of poverty.2",

The second mistake the alarmist stories make is ignoring the reality of adaptation.,
"We‚Äôve seen in previous chapters that much of what we have been told about climate change‚Äôs effects is misleading. Those impacts are the building blocks, as it were, of the total cost. When we allow for the reasonable assumption that people, communities, and countries will take reasonable measures to adapt to the effects of rising temperatures, then the damaging impacts of climate change turn out to be rather low. Indeed, many impacts, as we saw with hurricanes and extreme weather in general, might actually lead to lower, not higher, relative costs.",

"The animals had to press (or peck) a lever to get a reward, and, after extensive training, they would learn the length of the delays and amounts of food they could expect from pressing one lever or the other. By varying the delays and sizes of the rewards, the experimenter could estimate the animals‚Äô time preferences, and most studies found that animals display the same discounting pattern that leads to preference reversals in humans. Animals discount hyperbolically, and have self-control problems too!",
"And while loss aversion is certainly part of the explanation for our findings, there is a related phenomenon: inertia. In physics, an object in a state of rest stays that way, unless something happens. People act the same way: they stick with what they have unless there is some good reason to switch, or perhaps despite there being a good reason to switch. Economists William Samuelson and Richard Zeckhauser have dubbed this behavior ‚Äústatus quo bias.‚Äù",

"Cutting some carbon dioxide makes a lot of sense. First, it is easy to cut the first tons, because these are the lowest-hanging fruit. There are many places where efficiency can be obtained at low cost. You can stop heating the patio when nobody is outside, incurring just the minimal inconvenience of turning the heat off. Also, cutting these first tons has the largest benefit, because it cuts the highest and most damaging temperature rises.",
"The UN‚Äôs climate scientists looked at the evidence and concluded that globally, hurricanes are not getting more frequent: they find ‚Äúno significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency.‚Äù They do find an increase in storms in the North Atlantic, but link this to air pollution.

"The think-tank membership was convinced that all of humanity was doomed because too many people would consume too much, and we were about to kill ourselves and the planet with overpopulation, consumption, and pollution.

"A new 2019 study splits the damage across all major hazards‚Äîfrom flood, flash flood, and coastal flood, to heat and cold, to drought and wind damage.

In total, his family managed to cut emissions by around 20 percent, at a high personal and financial cost.",
"To relax the assumption that wealth is fungible and incorporate mental accounting into a theory of consumption and savings behavior, Hersh Shefrin and I proposed what we called the behavioral life-cycle hypothesis. We assume that a household‚Äôs consumption in a given year will not depend just on its lifetime wealth, but also on the mental accounts in which that wealth is held. The marginal propensity to consume from winning $1,000 in a lottery is likely to be much higher than a similar increase in the value of a household‚Äôs retirement holdings.",

"One innovation was the rebate, introduced by Chrysler in 1975, and quickly followed by Ford and GM. The car companies would announce a temporary sale whereby each buyer of a car would receive some cash back, usually a few hundred dollars. A rebate seems to be just another name for a temporary sale, but they seemed to be more popular than an equivalent reduction in price, as one might expect based on mental accounting. Suppose the list price of the car was $14,800. Reducing the price to $14,500 did not seem like a big deal, not a just-noticeable difference. But by calling the price reduction a rebate, the consumer was encouraged to think about the $300 separately, which would intensify its importance.",
"Of course, if we look around, we see counterexamples to this result all the time.

History hides Black Swans from us and gives us a mistaken idea about the odds of these events: this is the distortion of silent evidence.

"If you are dealing with quantities from Extremistan, you will have trouble figuring out the average from any sample since it can depend so much on one single observation. The idea is not more difficult than that. In Extremistan, one unit can easily affect the total in a disproportionate way. In this world, you should always be suspicious of the knowledge you derive from data. This is a very simple test of uncertainty that allows you to distinguish between the two kinds of randomness.",
"Matters that seem to belong to Extremistan (subjected to what we call type 2 randomness): wealth, income, book sales per author, book citations per author, name recognition as a ‚Äúcelebrity,‚Äù number of references on Google, populations of cities, uses of words in a vocabulary, numbers of speakers per language, damage caused by earthquakes, deaths in war, deaths from terrorist incidents, sizes of planets, sizes of companies, stock ownership, height between species (consider elephants and mice), financial markets (but your investment manager does not know it), commodity prices, inflation rates, economic data.",

"Categorizing always produces reduction in true complexity. It is a manifestation of the Black Swan generator, that unshakable Platonicity that I defined in the Prologue. Any reduction of the world around us can have explosive consequences since it rules out some sources of uncertainty; it drives us to a misunderstanding of the fabric of the world. For instance, you may think that radical Islam (and its values) are your allies against the threat of Communism, and so you may help them develop, until they send two planes into downtown Manhattan.",
"Imagine the heaviest person you can think of and add him to that sample. Assuming he weighs three times the average, between four hundred and five hundred pounds, he will rarely represent more than a very small fraction of the weight of the entire population (in this case, about a half of a percent).",
"The rest of this chapter will outline the Black Swan problem in its original form: How can we know the future, given knowledge of the past; or, more generally, how can we figure out properties of the (infinite) unknown based on the (finite) known? Think of the feeding again: What can a turkey learn about what is in store for it tomorrow from the events of yesterday? A lot, perhaps, but certainly a little less than it thinks, and it is just that ‚Äúlittle less‚Äù that may make all the difference.",

"The narrative fallacy addresses our limited ability to look at sequences of facts without weaving an explanation into them, or, equivalently, forcing a logical link, an arrow of relationship, upon them. Explanations bind facts together. They make them all the more easily remembered; they help them make more sense. Where this propensity can go wrong is when it increases our impression of understanding.",
The second problem is that information is also costly to store,

"From the standpoint of the turkey, the nonfeeding of the one thousand and first day is a Black Swan. For the butcher, it is not, since its occurrence is not unexpected. So you can see here that the Black Swan is a sucker‚Äôs problem. In other words, it occurs relative to your expectation. You realize that you can eliminate a Black Swan by science (if you‚Äôre able), or by keeping an open mind.",
Talk is cheap. Someone who took too many philosophy classes in college (or perhaps not enough) might object that the sighting of a Black Swan does not invalidate the theory that all swans are white since such a black bird is not technically a swan since whiteness to him may be the essential property of a swan.,

"Contrary to conventional wisdom, our body of knowledge does not increase from a series of confirmatory observations, like the turkey‚Äôs. But there are some things I can remain skeptical about, and others I can safely consider certain. This makes the consequences of observations one-sided. It is not much more difficult than that.",
"We learn from repetition‚Äîat the expense of events that have not happened before. Events that are nonrepeatable are ignored before their occurrence, and overestimated after (for a while). After a Black Swan, such as September 11, 2001, people expect it to recur when in fact the odds of that happening have arguably been lowered. We like to think about specific and known Black Swans when in fact the very nature of randomness lies in its abstraction. As I said in the Prologue, it is the wrong definition of a god.",

"In 1971, the psychologists Danny Kahneman and Amos Tversky plied professors of statistics with statistical questions not phrased as statistical questions. One was similar to the following (changing the example for clarity): Assume that you live in a town with two hospitals‚Äîone large, the other small. On a given day 60 percent of those born in one of the two hospitals are boys. Which hospital is it likely to be? Many statisticians made the equivalent of the mistake (during a casual conversation) of choosing the larger hospital, when in fact the very basis of statistics is that large samples are more stable and should fluctuate less from the long-term average‚Äîhere, 50 percent for each of the sexes‚Äîthan smaller samples.

"What we call here a Black Swan (and capitalize it) is an event with the following three attributes. First, it is an outlier, as it lies outside the realm of regular expectations, because nothing in the past can convincingly point to its possibility. Second, it carries an extreme impact (unlike the bird). Third, in spite of its outlier status, human nature makes us concoct explanations for its occurrence after the fact, making it explainable and predictable.",
"In his essay ‚ÄúWhat We See and What We Don‚Äôt See,‚Äù Bastiat offered the following idea: we can see what governments do, and therefore sing their praises‚Äîbut we do not see the alternative. But there is an alternative; it is less obvious and remains unseen.",

You can also be comfortable with what you have learned from the data. The epistemological consequence is that with Mediocristan-style randomness it is not possiblefn2 to have a Black Swan surprise such that a single event can dominate a phenomenon. Primo, the first hundred days should reveal all you need to know about the data. Secondo, even if you do have a surprise, as we saw in the case of the heaviest human, it would not be consequential.",

A massive flood somewhere in America in which more than a thousand people die. An earthquake in California, causing massive flooding, in which more than a thousand people die. Respondents estimated the first event to be less likely than the second. An earthquake in California, however, is a readily imaginable cause, which greatly increases the mental availability‚Äîhence the assessed probability‚Äîof the flood scenario.",
"Let us go one step further and consider induction‚Äôs most worrisome aspect: learning backward. Consider that the turkey‚Äôs experience may have, rather than no value, a negative value. It learned from observation, as we are all advised to do (hey, after all, this is what is believed to be the scientific method). Its confidence increased as the number of friendly feedings grew, and it felt increasingly safe even though the slaughter was more and more imminent. Consider that the feeling of safety reached its maximum when the risk was at the highest! But the problem is even more general than that; it strikes at the nature of empirical knowledge itself. Something has worked in the past, until‚Äîwell, it unexpectedly no longer does, and what we have learned from the past turns out to be at best irrelevant or false, at worst viciously misleading.",
"Look again at Figure 1 in Chapter 4; someone who observed the turkey‚Äôs first thousand days (but not the shock of the thousand and first) would tell you, and rightly so, that there is no evidence of the possibility of large events, i.e., Black Swans. You are likely to confuse that statement, however, particularly if you do not pay close attention, with the statement that there is evidence of no possible Black Swans.",
"Go ask your portfolio manager for his definition of ‚Äúrisk,‚Äù and odds are that he will supply you with a measure that excludes the possibility of the Black Swan‚Äîhence one that has no better predictive value for assessing the total risks than astrology (we will see how they dress up the intellectual fraud with mathematics). This problem is endemic in social matters.",
"Recall the turkey problem. You look at the past and derive some rule about the future. Well, the problems in projecting from the past can be even worse than what we have already learned, because the same past data can confirm a theory and also its exact opposite! If you survive until tomorrow, it could mean that either a) you are more likely to be immortal or b) that you are closer to death. Both conclusions rely on the exact same data. If you are a turkey being fed for a long period of time, you can either na√Øvely assume that feeding confirms your safety or be shrewd and consider that it confirms the danger of being turned into supper.",

"There is an exception, however: I know what statement is wrong, but not necessarily what statement is correct. If I see a black swan I can certify that all swans are not white! If I see someone kill, then I can be practically certain that he is a criminal. If I don‚Äôt see him kill, I cannot be certain that he is innocent. The same applies to cancer detection: the finding of a single malignant tumor proves that you have cancer, but the absence of such a finding cannot allow you to say with certainty that you are cancer-free.",

"I spoke about globalization in Chapter 3; it is here, but it is not all for the good: it creates interlocking fragility, while reducing volatility and giving the appearance of stability. In other words it creates devastating Black Swans. We have never lived before under the threat of a global collapse. Financial institutions have been merging into a smaller number of very large banks. Almost all banks are now interrelated. So the financial ecology is swelling into gigantic, incestuous, bureaucratic banks (often Gaussianized in their risk measurement)‚Äîwhen one falls, they all fall.fn4 The increased concentration among banks seems to have the effect of making financial crisis less likely, but when they happen they are more global in scale and hit us very hard.

Perhaps the ease with which one can project into the future by dragging cells in these spreadsheet programs is responsible for the armies of forecasters confidently producing longer-term forecasts,
"Consider that before we knew of bacteria, and their role in diseases, doctors rejected the practice of hand washing because it made no sense to them, despite the evidence of a meaningful decrease in hospital deaths. Ignaz Semmelweis, the mid-nineteenth-century doctor who promoted the idea of hand washing, wasn‚Äôt vindicated until decades after his death. Similarly it may not ‚Äúmake sense‚Äù that acupuncture works, but if pushing a needle in someone‚Äôs toe systematically produces relief from pain (in properly conducted empirical tests), then it could be that there are functions too complicated for us to understand, so let‚Äôs go with it for now while keeping our minds open.",
"The impulse on the part of the military is to devote resources to predicting the next problems. These thinkers advocate the opposite: invest in preparedness, not in prediction.",
"Middlebrow thinkers sometimes make the analogy of such strategy with that of collecting ‚Äúlottery tickets.‚Äù It is plain wrong. First, lottery tickets do not have a scalable payoff; there is a known upper limit to what they can deliver. The ludic fallacy applies here‚Äîthe scalability of real-life payoffs compared to lottery ones makes the payoff unlimited or of unknown limit. Secondly, the lottery tickets have known rules and laboratory-style well-presented possibilities; here we do not know the rules and can benefit from this additional uncertainty, since it cannot hurt you and can only benefit you.fn4",
"Consider this effect. Take a random sample of any two people from the U.S. population who jointly earn $1 million per annum. What is the most likely breakdown of their respective incomes?

"More significantly, this exponent begins to apply at some number called ‚Äúcrossover,‚Äù and addresses numbers larger than this crossover. It may start at 200,000 books, or perhaps only 400,000 books. Likewise, wealth has different properties before, say, $600 million, when inequality grows, than it does below such a number. How do you know where the crossover point is? This is a problem.",
"With projects of great novelty, such as a military invasion, an allout war, or something entirely new, errors explode upward. In fact, the more routine the task, the better you learn to forecast. But there is always something nonroutine in our modern environment.",

"Remember this: the Gaussian‚Äìbell curve variations face a headwind that makes probabilities drop at a faster and faster rate as you move away from the mean, while ‚Äúscalables,‚Äù or Mandelbrotian variations, do not have such a restriction. That‚Äôs pretty much most of what you need to know.",
"We can make good use of the Gaussian approach in variables for which there is a rational reason for the largest not to be too far away from the average. If there is gravity pulling numbers down, or if there are physical limitations preventing very large observations, we end up in Mediocristan. If there are strong forces of equilibrium bringing things back rather rapidly after conditions diverge from equilibrium, then again you can use the Gaussian approach.",
"It operates as follows. Kahneman and Tversky had their subjects spin a wheel of fortune. The subjects first looked at the number on the wheel, which they knew was random, then they were asked to estimate the number of African countries in the United Nations. Those who had a low number on the wheel estimated a low number of African nations; those with a high number produced a higher estimate.",
"As she lives beyond the expected date of death, the number of additional years to go decreases. This illustrates the major property of random variables related to the bell curve. The conditional expectation of additional life drops as a person gets older. With human projects and ventures we have another story. These are often scalable, as I said in Chapter 3. With scalable variables, the ones from Extremistan, you will witness the exact opposite effect. Let‚Äôs say a project is expected to terminate in 79 days, the same expectation in days as the newborn female has in years. On the 79th day, if the project is not finished, it will be expected to take another 25 days to complete. But on the 90th day, if the project is still not completed, it should have about 58 days to go. On the 100th, it should have 89 days to go. On the 119th, it should have an extra 149 days. On day 600, if the project is not done, you will be expected to need an extra 1,590 days. As you see, the longer you wait, the",

"Forecasting without incorporating an error rate uncovers three fallacies, all arising from the same misconception about the nature of uncertainty. The first fallacy: variability matters. The first error lies in taking a projection too seriously, without heeding its accuracy. Yet, for planning purposes, the accuracy in your forecast matters far more than the forecast itself. I will explain it as follows. Don‚Äôt",
"The reference point argument is as follows: do not compute odds from the vantage point of the winning gambler (or the lucky Casanova, or the endlessly bouncing back New York City, or the invincible Carthage), but from all those who started in the cohort. Consider once again the example of the gambler. If you look at the population of beginning gamblers taken as a whole, you can be close to certain that one of them (but you do not know in advance which one) will show stellar results just by luck. So, from the reference point of the beginning cohort, this is not a big deal. But from the reference point of the winner (and, who does not, and this is key, take the losers into account), a long string of wins will appear to be too extraordinary an occurrence to be explained by luck. Note that a ‚Äúhistory‚Äù is just a series of numbers through time. The numbers can represent degrees of wealth, fitness, weight, anything.",

In general, the superego is pleased when we comply with society's ethics, and unhappy when we don't. This is why we stop our car at four AM when we see a red light, even if we know that no one is around; and it is why we get a warm feeling when we return a lost wallet to its owner, even if our identity is never revealed.

But what would happen if we replaced the payments with a gift? Surely your mother-in-law would accept a good bottle of wine at dinner. Or how about a housewarming present (such as an eco-friendly plant) for a friend? Are gifts methods of exchange that keep us within the social exchange norms?,

"My experience indicates that the degree of sensitivity or resistance to LSD depends on complicated psychological factors rather than on variables of a constitutional, biological, or metabolic nature. Subjects who in everyday life have the need to maintain full self-control and have difficulties in relaxing and ‚Äúletting go‚Äù can sometimes resist relatively high dosages of LSD (300 to 500 micrograms) and show no detectable changes. Occasionally, a person can resist a considerable dose of LSD if he has set this as a personal task for himself for any reason.",
"The view of LSD has thus covered a wide range, from a spiritual, emotional, and social panacea for mankind and a powerful therapeutic tool for individuals suffering from serious mental and psychosomatic disorders to a vicious enemy causing organic brain impairment and serious physical and mental damage to the individual and endangering the well-being of future generations.

"Instead of a gradual unfolding of different levels of the unconscious such as was observed in my European approach, the goal here was to facilitate the occurrence of a deep religious and mystical experience, sometimes at the expense of bypassing areas of conflicts on the psychodynamic level. Clinical data suggested that these experiences had a unique therapeutic potential in the treatment of various emotional disorders; changes were frequently so dramatic that they seemed to warrant systematic exploration. The dosages used in this approach were rather high, ranging between 300 and 500 micrograms. Patients were encouraged to stay in a reclining position for most of the session, keep their eyes covered with eyeshades, and listen to selected stereophonic music through headphones.",
"Likewise for the superstitious gambler or the end-of-the-world prophet: when their theory is refuted by experience, they do indeed switch to a new one; but, because their underlying explanations are bad, they can easily accommodate the new experience without changing the substance of the explanation. Without a good explanatory theory, they can simply reinterpret the omens, pick a new date, and make essentially the same prediction. In such cases, testing one‚Äôs theory and abandoning it when it is refuted constitutes no progress towards understanding the world.

The basic idea of this approach was that consecutive sessions might make it possible for patients gradually to confront various levels of their unconscious and resolve deep conflicts underlying their psychopathological symptoms.,
"So historically it was empiricism that first provided a plausible defence for experimental science as we now know it.

"‚ÄúThis is really just the beginning,‚Äù34 explains Autodesk distinguished researcher and synthetic biologist Andrew Hessel. ‚ÄúPretty much any substance made by a plant, tree or mushroom, including all the neuroactive substances, is within reach of synthetic biology. We‚Äôre not there yet, but within a decade or so this one technology should be able to tickle all the same receptor sites in the brain that mind-altering substances impact.‚Äù",
"Pleasure produces endorphins, but pain can prompt even more. The uncertainty of teasing, as Stanford‚Äôs Robert Sapolsky established, spikes dopamine 400 percent. Nipple stimulation boosts oxytocin. Pressure in the throat or colon regulates the vagus nerve,23 creating exhilaration, intense relaxation, and goose bumps, what Princeton gastroenterologist Anish Sheth memorably terms poo-phoria.",
"‚ÄúPsychology is not just the study of weakness and damage, it is also the study of strength and virtue. Treatment is not just fixing what is broken, it is nurturing what is best within ourselves.‚Äù",
"The analysis of these records indicated clearly that the LSD reaction is highly specific for the personality of the subject. Rather than causing an unspecific ‚Äútoxic psychosis,‚Äù LSD appeared to be a powerful catalyst of the mental processes activating unconscious material from various deep levels of the personality.",
"A rather striking aspect of the LSD effect is a marked intensification of all mental processes and neural processes in general; this involves phenomena of a different nature and origin. Pre-existing and recent psychogenic symptoms as well as those that the individual had suffered from in childhood or at some later period of his life can be exteriorized, amplified, and experienced in the LSD sessions.",
Thus the Enlightenment was a revolution in how people sought knowledge: by trying not to rely on authority.,
"Scientific theories are explanations: assertions about what is out there and how it behaves. Where do these theories come from? For most of the history of science, it was mistakenly believed that we ‚Äòderive‚Äô them from the evidence of our senses ‚Äì a philosophical doctrine known as empiricism:",
"But one thing that all conceptions of the Enlightenment agree on is that it was a rebellion, and specifically a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge.",
"Marketing researcher and consultant Martin Lindstrom teamed up with British neuroscientist Gemma Calvert for the project. Over the course of three years, they used both fMRI and EEG to scan the brains of more than two thousand people as they made a variety of buying decisions. The researchers discovered that product placement34 in TV shows and movies rarely works, that warning labels of cigarettes actually prime the urge to smoke more, and that‚Äîmost surprisingly‚Äîshopping and spirituality seem to rely on similar neuronal circuitry.",
"As Nietzsche said: ‚Äúmadness is rare in individuals‚Äîbut in groups, political parties, nations and eras, it‚Äôs the rule.‚Äù",
"In the case of IMAX, for instance, why go to see these movies at all? In a few months, we could catch the identical film in the comfort of our homes. Instead, we drive to faraway theaters and pay a premium for total immersion: surround sound that shakes our seats, forty-foot screens that swallow our vision, and the company of others who gasp, boo, and clap alongside us. We don‚Äôt pay extra to see more, we pay it to feel more‚Äîand think less.",
"Whether we‚Äôre examining psychedelics like LSD or empathogens like MDMA, mind-altering drugs are more popular than at any other time in history. Thirty-two million Americans use psychedelics51 on a regular basis (that‚Äôs nearly one in ten) and report considered reasons for doing so. According to a 2013 study published in a journal of the National Institutes of Health,52 the most common motivations are to ‚Äúenhance mystical experiences, introspection and curiosity.‚Äù Transcendence, not decadence, appears to be driving use forward.",
"But the cascade of neurobiological change that occurs in a non-ordinary state lets us perceive and process more of what‚Äôs going on around us and with greater accuracy. In these states, we get upstream of our umwelt. We get access to increased data, heightened perception, and amplified connection. And this lets us see ecstasis for what it actually is: an information technology. Big Data for our minds.",
The capacity of LSD and some other psychedelic drugs to exteriorize otherwise invisible phenomena and processes and make them the subject of scientific investigation gives these substances a unique potential as diagnostic instruments and as research tools for the exploration of the human mind. It does not seem inappropriate and exaggerated to compare their potential significance for psychiatry and psychology to that of the microscope for medicine or the telescope for astronomy.,
"The second fundamental misconception in inductivism is that scientific theories predict that ‚Äòthe future will resemble the past‚Äô, and that ‚Äòthe unseen resembles the seen‚Äô and so on. (Or that it ‚Äòprobably‚Äô will.) But in reality the future is unlike the past, the unseen very different from the seen. Science often predicts ‚Äì and brings about ‚Äì phenomena spectacularly different from anything that has been experienced before. For millennia people dreamed about flying, but they experienced only falling. Then they discovered good explanatory theories about flying, and then they flew ‚Äì in that order.",
"First, inductivism purports to explain how science obtains predictions about experiences. But most of our theoretical knowledge simply does not take that form. Scientific explanations are about reality, most of which does not consist of anyone‚Äôs experiences. Astrophysics is not primarily about us (what we shall see if we look at the sky), but about what stars are: their composition and what makes them shine, and how they formed, and the universal laws of physics under which that happened. Most of that has never been observed: no one has experienced a billion years, or a light year; no one could have been present at the Big Bang; no one will ever touch a law of physics ‚Äì except in their minds, through theory.",
"It is a classic example of the deceptiveness of the senses: the Earth looks and feels as though it is at rest beneath our feet, even though it is really rotating. As for the celestial sphere, despite being visible in broad daylight (as the sky), it does not exist at all.",
And we now know why. Our facial expressions are hardwired5 into our emotions: we can‚Äôt have one without the other. Botox lessens depression because it prevents us from making sad faces. But it also dampens our connection to those around us because we feel empathy by mimicking each other‚Äôs facial expressions.,
"As Buddhist scholar Alan Watts put it, ‚ÄòWestern scientists have an underlying assumption that normal is absolutely as good as it gets and that the exceptional is only for saints, that it is something that cannot be cultivated.‚Äô‚Äù",
"Plato described ecstasis as an altered state where our normal waking consciousness vanishes completely, replaced by an intense euphoria and a powerful connection to a greater intelligence.",
"So potent is the urge to get out of our heads that it functions as a ‚Äúfourth drive,‚Äù a behavior-shaping force as powerful as our first three drives‚Äîthe desire for food, water, and sex.",
Even a quick glance at today‚Äôs dire mental health statistics‚Äîthe one in four Americans now on psychiatric medicines;23 the escalating rate of suicide24 for everyone from ages ten to seventy-eight‚Äîshows how critically overtaxed our mental processing is these days.,
"In this book I argue that all progress, both theoretical and practical, has resulted from a single human activity: the quest for what I call good explanations. Though this quest is uniquely human, its effectiveness is also a fundamental fact about reality at the most impersonal, cosmic level ‚Äì namely that it conforms to universal laws of nature that are indeed good explanations. This simple relationship between the cosmic and the human is a hint of a central role of people in the cosmic scheme of things.",
That is what makes good explanations essential to science: it is only when a theory is a good explanation ‚Äì hard to vary ‚Äì that it even matters whether it is testable. Bad explanations are equally useless whether they are testable or not.,
"It trivially implies that prediction alone is insufficient. Somewhat less trivially, it leads to the rejection of authority, because if we adopt a theory on authority, that means that we would also have accepted a range of different theories on authority. And hence it also implies the need for a tradition of criticism. It also implies a methodological rule ‚Äì a criterion for reality ‚Äì namely that we should conclude that a particular thing is real if and only if it figures in our best explanation of something.",
"Once information technology become perceptual‚Äîas in the case of nonordinary states‚Äîthe Cycle becomes even more powerful. Our mind becomes the platform. The tug-of-war between access and control becomes a battle for cognitive liberty. And while nation states have consistently sought to regulate external chemicals that shape consciousness, what happens when they attempt to regulate internal neurochemistry? If that sounds far-fetched, consider that elite athletes already submit ‚Äúbiological passports‚Äù to the World Anti-Doping Agency15 to confirm their unique baselines for hormones, blood profiles, and neurochemicals. If they fluctuate from that baseline without official permission, they are penalized and even brought up on criminal charges. Much in the same way that regimes used to declare certain books subversive, it‚Äôs not too much of a stretch to imagine a government declaring certain brain chemistry subversive. A telltale combination of neurotransmitters coursing through your bloodstrea",
"After all this, Lilly came to one overarching conclusion: ‚ÄúWhat one believes to be true is true or becomes true, within certain limits to be found experientially and experimentally. These limits are further beliefs to be transcended. In the province of the mind, there are no limits.‚Äù If he was right, and there really are no limits to consciousness, then the point is not to keep going until we find it all, but to come back before we‚Äôve lost it all. Because it really doesn‚Äôt matter what we find down there, out there, or up there, if we‚Äôre unable to bring it back to solid ground. So take it all in, but hold it loosely. And most critically, Don‚Äôt Dive Too Deep.",
"Second, contemplative and mystical states, where techniques like chanting, dance, meditation, sexuality, and, most recently, wearable technologies are used to shut off the self.",
"The Japanese get at this same idea with the concept of wabi sabi30‚Äîor the ability to find beauty in imperfection. If a vase is accidentally broken, for example, they don‚Äôt throw the pieces away or try to patch it up to hide the accident. Instead, they take golden glue and painstakingly reassemble the vessel, so its unique flaws make the piece more beautiful.",
"The Indian philosopher Nisargadatta summed up the dilemma well: ‚ÄúLove tells me I am everything. Wisdom tells me I am nothing.28 And between these two banks, flows the river of my life.‚Äù If we map this idea onto what we know about nonordinary states, then Nisargadatta‚Äôs ‚Äúeverything/nothing‚Äù dialectic isn‚Äôt just flowery wisdom, it‚Äôs the by-product of the neurobiology of ecstasis itself.",
"‚ÄúGames are a multi-billion dollar industry that employ the best neuroscientists42 and behavior psychologists to make them as addicting as possible,‚Äù Nicholas Kardaras, one of the country‚Äôs top addiction specialists, recently explained to Vice. ‚ÄúThe developers strap beta-testing teens with galvanic skin responses, EKG, and blood pressure gauges. If the game doesn‚Äôt spike their blood pressure to 180 over 140, they go back and tweak the game to make it have more of an adrenaline-rush effect.¬†.¬†.¬†. Video games raise dopamine to the same degree that sex does, and almost as much as cocaine does. So this combo of adrenaline and dopamine are a potent one-two punch with regards to addiction.‚Äù",
"Ironically, the attempt to avoid suffering often creates more of it, leaving us susceptible to the most predictable trap of all: spiritual bypassing. ‚Äú[It‚Äôs] a widespread tendency to use spiritual ideas and practices,‚Äù26 says John Welwood, the psychologist who coined the term, ‚Äúto sidestep or avoid facing unresolved emotional issues, psychological wounds, and unfinished developmental tasks.‚Äù",
"‚ÄúTell me what you value and I might believe you,‚Äù management guru Peter Drucker once said, ‚Äúbut show me your calendar and your bank statement, and I‚Äôll show you what you really value.‚Äù So we decided to take Drucker‚Äôs advice and follow the money.",
"Soon VR systems are going to track everything from eye gaze to vocal tone to‚Äîas DARPA-style biometrics get further integrated‚Äîneurochemistry, hormones, brainwaves, and cardiac coherence. ‚ÄúThis comprehensive tracking of your behavior inside these worlds,‚Äù45 continues Kelly, ‚Äúcould be used to sell you things, to redirect your attention, to compile a history of your interests, to persuade you subliminally, to quantify your actions for self-improvement¬†.¬†.¬†. and so on. If a smartphone is a surveillance device we voluntarily carry in our pocket, then VR will be a total surveillance state we voluntarily enter.‚Äù",
"Finally, psychedelic states, where the recent resurgence in sanctioned research is leading to some of the more intriguing pharmacological findings in several decades. Taken together, these three categories define our territory of ecstasis.",
"During the states we‚Äôre describing,23 this signature shifts markedly. Instead of widespread activity in the prefrontal cortex, we see specific parts of this region either light up and become hyperactive or power down and become hypoactive. At the same time, brainwaves slow from agitated beta to daydreamy alpha and deeper theta. Neurochemically, stress chemicals like norepinephrine and cortisol are replaced by performance-enhancing, pleasure-producing compounds such as dopamine, endorphins, anandamide, serotonin, and oxytocin.",
"Your story must reflect change over time. A story cannot simply be a series of remarkable events. You must start out as one version of yourself and end as something new. The change can be infinitesimal. It need not reflect an improvement in yourself or your character, but change must happen. Even the worst movies in the world reflect some change in a character over time. So",
"Storytellers use conflation to push all the emotion of an event into a single time frame, because stories are more entertaining this way. Rather than describing change over a long period, we compress all the intellectual and emotional transformation into a smaller bit of time, because this is what audiences expect from stories.",
"No one built an off switch for the potent self-awareness that made it all possible. ‚Äú[T]he self ‚Äúis not an unmitigated blessing,‚Äù6 writes Duke University psychologist Mark Leary in his aptly titled book, The Curse of the Self. ‚ÄúIt is single-handedly responsible for many, if not most of the problems that human beings face as individuals and as a species¬†.¬†.¬†. [and] conjures up a great deal of personal suffering in the form of depression, anxiety, anger, jealousy, and other negative emotions.‚Äù",
"In more contemporary terms, the Eleusinian Mysteries were an elaborate nine-day ritual designed to strip away standard frames of reference, profoundly alter consciousness, and unlock a heightened level of insight. Specifically, the mysteries combined a number of state-changing techniques‚Äîfasting, singing, dancing, drumming, costumes, dramatic storytelling, physical exhaustion, and kykeon (the substance Alcibiades stole for his party)‚Äîto induce a cathartic experience of death, rebirth, and ‚Äúdivine inspiration.‚Äù",

"Unlike analog sex, viewing porn has no evolutionary payoff. So why do so many do it so often? Because, for a brief moment (and it really is brief‚Äîan average PornHub visit clocks in at seven and half minutes), we lose ourselves in a state of physiological arousal and neurochemical saturation. Put bluntly, we watch porn to get high, not to get laid.",
This is what I call the Spider-Man Principle of Meetings and Presentations (though Voltaire admittedly said it first): ‚ÄúWith great power comes great responsibility.‚Äù,
"Like Jurassic Park, the real story isn‚Äôt about the big thing. In fact, when people talk to me about the story, they rarely mention the car accident or my near-death experience. Instead, they speak about my five-second moment, when I find myself alone in the emergency room two hours after the accident, waiting for surgeons to operate on my ruined legs. Upon hearing that I was in stable condition, my parents decide to check on the car before checking on me, leaving me alone, frightened, and in terrible pain in the corner of a cold, sterile emergency room. Except it turns out that I‚Äôm not alone, because my friends from McDonald‚Äôs find out about the accident and quickly fill the waiting room, making the kind of noise that only a gang of teenagers can make.",
"This is the trick to telling a big story: it cannot be about anything big. Instead we must find the small, relatable, comprehensible moments in our larger stories. We must find the piece of the story that people can connect to, relate to, and understand.",
"Second, starting your story with a thesis statement reduces your chances of surprising your audience. When you tell me that the story is hilarious, I‚Äôm already primed for humor.",
"Some people remember their scenes in a list, but I actually remember these scenes as circles in my mind. The size of the circle reflects the size of the scene. The color of the circle reflects the tone and tenor of the scene.",

"When we say ecstasis we‚Äôre talking about a very specific range of nonordinary states of consciousness (NOSC)21‚Äîwhat Johns Hopkins psychiatrist Stanislav Grof defined as those experiences ‚Äúcharacterized by dramatic perceptual changes, intense and often unusual emotions, profound alterations in the thought processes and behavior, [brought about] by a variety of psychosomatic manifestations, rang[ing] from profound terror to ecstatic rapture¬†.¬†.¬†.

"But once we get past the narrative wrapping paper‚Äîwhat researchers call the ‚Äúphenomenological reporting‚Äù‚Äîwe find four signature characteristics underneath: Selflessness, Timelessness, Effortlessness, and Richness, or STER for short.",
"With the recent advancements in neurobiology, we now have options: Embodied cognition teaches us that how we move our bodies affects our brains and minds. AI therapy proves that our subconscious expressions can reflect our inner state more accurately than we do. Precognition demonstrates that we can anticipate how we‚Äôre going to feel and think in the future by tracking (and even altering) our biometrics in the present. Neurotheology integrates all of these findings and lets us reverse-engineer a whole host of nonordinary states, just by working backward from our neurophysiology.",
"Yes, dinner companion. If you are on a first date, your goal should be to share information about yourself in an entertaining fashion. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†This is who I am. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†This is what I believe. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†This is what I want. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†This is what I dream. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†How about you?",
"One other aspect to the but-and-therefore principle: the power of the negative. Oddly, the negative is almost always better than the positive when it comes to storytelling. Saying what something or someone is not is almost always better than saying what something or someone is. For example: ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I am dumb, ugly, and unpopular. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I‚Äôm not smart, I‚Äôm not at all good-looking, and no one likes me.",
"Regardless of whether your change is infinitesimal or profound, positive or negative, your story must reflect change. You must begin and end your story in entirely different states of being. Change is key. The story of how you‚Äôre an amazing person who did an amazing thing and ended up in an amazing place is not a story. It‚Äôs a recipe for a douchebag. The story of how you‚Äôre a pathetic person who did a pathetic thing and remained pathetic is also not a story. It‚Äôs a recipe for a sad sack.",
"A Backpack is a strategy that increases the stakes of the story by increasing the audience‚Äôs anticipation about a coming event. It‚Äôs when a storyteller loads up the audience with all the storyteller‚Äôs hopes and fears in that moment before moving the story forward. It‚Äôs an attempt to do two things: ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†¬†Make the audience wonder what will happen next. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†¬†Make your audience experience the same emotion, or something like the same emotion, that the storyteller experienced in the moment about to be described.",
Storytellers use Breadcrumbs when we hint at a future event but only reveal enough to keep the audience guessing.,
"But, really, stoned dolphins should have surprised no one. Psychopharmacologists have spent the past few decades3 cataloguing the consciousness-altering techniques of animals in the wild and they have found plenty to document. Dogs lick toads for the buzz, horses go crazy for locoweed, goats gobble magic mushrooms, birds chew marijuana seeds, cats enjoy catnip, wallabies ravage poppy fields, reindeer indulge fly agaric mushrooms, baboons prefer iboga, sheep delight in hallucinogenic lichen, and elephants get drunk on fermented fruit (though they‚Äôve also been known to raid breweries).",

"This response has a paradoxical name: vulnerable strength. Bren√© Brown, whose books and TED talks on the subject have resonated with massive audiences, explains it this way: ‚ÄúEmbracing our vulnerabilities is risky but not nearly as dangerous as giving27 up on love and belonging and joy‚Äîthe experiences that make us the most vulnerable.

"We use the word ‚Äúneed‚Äù much too casually. The only things we truly need are the basics of physical survival‚Äîair, water, food, clothing, shelter‚Äîand everyone reading this book already has these.",
"In his work with heart rate variability, Siegel‚Äôs found that by upgrading the tone to include a visual display, and adding in an EEG layer‚Äîso there‚Äôs neurofeedback to go along with the biofeedback‚Äîhe can get whole groups of people to synchronize their heart rates and brainwaves and drive them into group flow. His new challenge is to take this same technology and make an affordable version that‚Äôs available to everyone.",
"Contemporary scientists have slightly different terms and descriptions. They call the experience ‚Äúgroup flow.‚Äù ‚Äú[It‚Äôs] a peak state,‚Äù explains psychologist Keith Sawyer in his book Group Genius,4 ‚Äúa group performing at its top level of ability.¬†.¬†.¬†. In situations of rapid change, it‚Äôs more important than ever for a group to be able to merge action and awareness, to adjust immediately by improvising.‚Äù Whatever",
This is why tiny moments like the one at my dining-room table with my wife and children often make the best stories. These are the moments that connect with people. These are the stories that touch people‚Äôs hearts.,
"The woman doesn‚Äôt tell me her name. She‚Äôs just crying. A second later she starts talking. She tells me that she took a storytelling workshop with me six months before. She had listened closely as I assigned her Homework for Life, and she started doing it that night. She‚Äôs calling to tell me that she‚Äôs fifty-two years old, and for her entire life, she‚Äôd never felt like an important person in this world. She‚Äôd always thought that she was just like everyone else ‚Äî simply another face in the crowd ‚Äî and that one day in the future, she was going to die and ‚Äúgo out quietly. Unnoticed.‚Äù Then she started doing my Homework for Life, and within three months, it had changed her life. She says that searching for stories in her everyday life and recording them has made her feel like an important person for the first time.",
"It‚Äôs called First Last Best Worst. All you need to play is pen and paper. As you can see from the worksheet that follows, the top row of the page (the x-axis) is labeled with the words ‚ÄúFirst,‚Äù ‚ÄúLast,‚Äù ‚ÄúBest,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWorst,‚Äù along with a column labeled ‚ÄúPrompts.‚Äù Along the left side of the page (the y-axis), the prompts are listed. The prompts are the possible triggers for memories. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†What was your first kiss? ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†What was your last kiss? ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†What was your best kiss? ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†What was your worst kiss?",
Avoid thesis statements in storytelling.,
"Lastly, the story must pass the Dinner Test. The Dinner Test is simply this: Is the story that you craft for the stage, the boardroom, the sales conference, or the Sunday sermon similar to the story you would tell a friend at dinner? This should be the goal.",
"Just listen to someone tell you about their vacation to Europe or their weekend at the beach. It‚Äôs almost never a good story. It‚Äôs almost never something you want to hear. Why? ‚ÄúFirst we went here, and it was amazing, and then we went here, and it was also amazing, and then we saw this, which was so amazing.‚Äù",
This is the magic of the present tense. It creates a sense of immediacy.,

"Many times storytellers fail to understand the importance of these five-second moments. They see the big when they should be looking for the small. They come to me and say, ‚ÄúI went to Tanzania last summer. I want to tell that story onstage.‚Äù My answer is always the same: No. Visiting Tanzania is not a story. Your ability to travel the world does not mean that you can tell a good story or even have a good story to tell. But if something happened in Tanzania that altered you in some deep and fundamental way, then you might have a story. If you experienced a five-second moment in Tanzania, you might have something. Think of it this way: If we remove Tanzania from the story, do you still have a story worth telling?",
"My favorite storyteller in the world ‚Äî Steve Zimmer ‚Äî does this in a story entitled ‚ÄúNeighborhood Watch.‚Äù After Steve‚Äôs family is not invited to the neighborhood Hawaiian luau, they decide to host the Zimmer family barbecue, which features ‚ÄúZimmers, pineapple-flavored ham, and despair.‚Äù",
"This is the moment to use an Hourglass. It‚Äôs time to slow things down. Grind them to a halt when possible. When you know the audience is hanging on your every word, let them hang. Drag out the wait as long as possible.",
"I was speechless the first time this happened. I called Elysha immediately after the show to tell her. Elysha‚Äôs response was surprising. ‚ÄúOf course she wanted to tell you,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou stood on that stage and talked about one of your most difficult moments in your life with complete honesty. Your story made you safe to talk to. And she never needs to see you again. She could unburden herself of this secret to someone she knew she could trust, and she doesn‚Äôt have to see you at work or home the next day.‚Äù It made sense.",
"Like all other emotional responses (see the previous chapter), humor is based entirely on surprise. A combination of specific words spoken in a specific way at a specific moment initiates a surprise that sparks a smile, a giggle, or actual laughter.",
"The same thing happens later in that story, when I say, ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Matt, and I‚Äôm collecting money for Ronald McDonald Children‚Äôs Charities.‚Äù It‚Äôs the most surprising moment of the story. People either gasp or laugh when they hear me say those words. If you‚Äôll remember, I accentuate this surprise with a Breadcrumb and an Hourglass. I give a hint about what is to come (a crumpled McDonald‚Äôs uniform), and I make the audience wait forever to hear it by slowing my speech and adding enormous amounts of unnecessary description and repetition. Can you imagine how less surprising the moment would be if I had climbed into my car, spotted the crumpled McDonald‚Äôs uniform, and said, ‚ÄúI know. I‚Äôm going to go door-to-door pretending to be a charity worker.‚Äù Still surprising, perhaps, but not nearly so. Yet",
"Your big stories could be about a vacation to exotic locales or the birth of a child or your wedding day or the untimely death of a loved one. Any of these could be told well if you find a way to make the story smaller than it seems. This is hard to do. Rarely are stories of birth or death or weddings or vacations good. They are more often ordinary, expected, and boring. Clich√©. But this need not be the case.",
"Linke Liberale, also Liberale, die Freiheit nicht mit dem Faustrecht des St√§rkeren verwechseln, sondern zugleich soziale Verantwortung einfordern, gibt es auch heute noch. Sie sind in diesem Abschnitt nicht gemeint.",
"But I‚Äôm not thinking about this chapter at all. My mind is focused on Charlie and his fidgeting. He needs to pee. He‚Äôs needed to pee since Aberdeen, New Jersey, but he‚Äôs afraid of the restrooms on the train. In his words, ‚ÄúThey are yuck.‚Äù The situation is becoming precarious. I need this boy to pee, but it turns out that you can‚Äôt make a human being pee, even if you‚Äôre forty years older, 150 pounds heavier, and his father. There are just some things that can‚Äôt be done without consent. Peeing is one of these things.",
"The audience doesn‚Äôt know why they are listening to the story or what is to come, so it‚Äôs easy to stop listening. If you don‚Äôt present a reason to listen very early on, you risk losing their attention altogether.",
"So how do you choose the right place to start a story? Simple. Ask yourself where your story ends. What is the meaning of your five-second moment? Say it aloud. In ‚ÄúCharity Thief,‚Äù I might say it like this: ‚ÄúI thought I was alone in this world, facing a lifetime of loneliness. Then I met a man who taught me that I knew very little about loneliness and never wanted to know loneliness the way that man knew it on that day and probably many, many days thereafter.‚Äù",
Four times I have stepped off the stage at a storytelling show and been approached by a woman who wanted to share the story of her miscarriage with me.,
"That‚Äôs the trick. A simple one: Make sure that every moment in your story has a location attached. Every moment should be a scene, and every scene needs a setting.",
"Eventually the Elephant in my story changes color. The story isn‚Äôt really about escaping New Hampshire at all. It‚Äôs really a story about understanding the nature of loneliness. I change the color of the Elephant halfway through this story. I present the audience with one Elephant, but then I paint it another color. I trick them. This is an excellent storytelling strategy: make your audience think they are on one path, and then when they least expect it, show them that they have been on a different path all along.",
"In ‚ÄúCharity Thief,‚Äù I drop a Breadcrumb when I say: But as I climb back into the car, I see my crumpled McDonald‚Äôs uniform on the backseat, and I suddenly have an idea.",
"True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you‚Äôll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity.",
"This finding contradicted the prevailing view at the time, which considered heroin addiction to be a permanent and irreversible condition. Instead, Robins revealed that addictions could spontaneously dissolve if there was a radical change in the environment.",
"Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do. In Byrne‚Äôs case, he bundled watching Netflix (the thing he wanted to do) with riding his stationary bike (the thing he needed to do).",
"The cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms‚Äîthe feel of your phone buzzing in your pocket, the smell of chocolate chip cookies, the sound of ambulance sirens‚Äîbut the two most common cues are time and location.",
"This is how most big stories operate. At least the good ones. Big stories contain these tiny, utterly human moments. We may be fooled by whips and snakes and car chases, but if it‚Äôs a good story, our protagonist is going to experience something deep and meaningful that resonates with the audience, even if the audience doesn‚Äôt fully realize it.",
"As you start to see importance and meaning in each day, you suddenly understand your importance to this world. You start to see how the meaningful moments that we experience every day contribute to the lives of others and to the world. You start to sense the critical nature of your very existence. There are no more throwaway days. Every day can change the world in some small way. In fact, every day has been changing the world for as long as you‚Äôve been alive. You just haven‚Äôt noticed yet.",
"It‚Äôs the perfect time to use an Hourglass. Stakes. The desire of an audience to hear the next sentence, made greater by the deliberate slowing down of action and pace. Find the moment in your story that everyone has been waiting for, then flip that Hourglass and let the sand run.",
"Once you have adopted an identity, it can be easy to let your allegiance to it impact your ability to change. Many people walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the norms attached to their identity. ‚ñ† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm terrible with directions.‚Äù ‚ñ† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a morning person.‚Äù ‚ñ† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bad at remembering people‚Äôs names.‚Äù ‚ñ† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always late.‚Äù ‚ñ† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not good with technology.‚Äù ‚ñ† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm horrible at math.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ and a thousand other variations. When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact.",
"The purpose of resetting each room is not simply to clean up after the last action, but to prepare for the next action. ‚ÄúWhen I walk into a room everything is in its right place,‚Äù Nuckols wrote. ‚ÄúBecause I do this every day in every room, stuff always stays in good shape ‚Ä¶. People think I work hard but I‚Äôm actually really lazy. I‚Äôm just proactively lazy. It gives you so much time back.‚Äù",
"By implanting electrodes in the brains of rats, the researchers blocked the release of dopamine. To the surprise of the scientists, the rats lost all will to live.10 They wouldn‚Äôt eat. They wouldn‚Äôt have sex. They didn‚Äôt crave anything. Within a few days, the animals died of thirst.",
"Within months, the researchers saw a rapid shift in the health of children in the neighborhood. The rate of diarrhea fell by 52 percent; pneumonia by 48 percent; and impetigo, a bacterial skin infection, by 35 percent.5 The long-term effects were even better.",
"Behind every system of actions is a system of beliefs. The system of a democracy is founded on beliefs like freedom, majority rule, and social equality. The system of a dictatorship has a very different set of beliefs like absolute authority and strict obedience.",
"‚ÄúIn Pakistan, Safeguard was a premium soap,‚Äù Luby told me.4 ‚ÄúThe study participants commonly mentioned how much they liked it.‚Äù",
"Luby and his team realized that in an environment with poor sanitation, the simple habit of washing your hands could make a real difference in the health of the residents. But they soon discovered that many people were already aware that handwashing was important.",
"A lie of progression is when a storyteller changes the order of events in a story to make it more emotionally satisfying or comprehensible to the listener. In my experience, this is the least common lie told, and I have never done it myself, but I‚Äôve recommended that other storytellers use it from time to time.",
These five-second moments are the moments in your life when something fundamentally changes forever. You fall in love. You fall out of love. You discover something new about yourself or another person. Your opinion on a subject dramatically changes. You find forgiveness. You reach acceptance. You sink into despair. You grudgingly resign. You‚Äôre drowned in regret. You make a life-altering decision. Choose a new path. Accomplish something great. Fail spectacularly.,
"Finding stories from your life can have the same effect. They can fill in the forgotten moments of your life while expanding your previously perceived boundaries. Moments that once lacked meaning and relevance can suddenly be recognized as critical and essential to your life story. Make it your mission to find, see, remember, and identify stories, and you will begin to see your life in a new and more compelling light.",
Pay attention to the opening scenes of movies. So many of them use this strategy as well. We open on the protagonist or someone similarly important to the story. That person will be moving. Walking. Running. Driving. Flying. Climbing. Fleeing. Falling. Swimming. Crawling. Diving. Filmmakers want to immerse you into their world as quickly as possible. They want you to forget the theater and the popcorn and the jackass who is texting beside you. They want you to be absorbed by the story. They want you to forget that you even exist for the duration of the film.,
"Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past.",
"Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to changing your identity. The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do. ‚ñ† Each time you write a page, you are a writer. ‚ñ† Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician. ‚ñ† Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete. ‚ñ† Each time you encourage your employees, you are a leader.",
"I like to refer to this technique as the Paper Clip Strategy and, over the years, I‚Äôve heard from readers who have employed it in a variety of ways. One woman shifted a hairpin from one container to another whenever she wrote a page of her book. Another man moved a marble from one bin to the next after each set of push-ups.",
What makes me lose track of time? Flow is the mental state you enter when you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of the world fades away.19 This blend of happiness and peak performance is what athletes and performers experience when they are ‚Äúin the zone.‚Äù,
"Each habit is like a suggestion: ‚ÄúHey, maybe this is who I am.‚Äù If you finish a book, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes reading. If you go to the gym, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes exercise. If you practice playing the guitar, perhaps you are the type of person who likes music.",
You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.,
"This was my five-second moment. It was the moment when I realized that I had family after all. My friends were my family, and they remained the only family I had and the only family I needed until I met my wife fifteen years later. It might be the greatest five-second moment of my life.",
"It‚Äôs hard to be authentic and vulnerable when you‚Äôre reciting lines. It‚Äôs also obvious to an audience when a storyteller is simply reciting a story instead of telling a story. Instead of memorizing your story word-for-word, memorize three parts to a story: ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†¬†The first few sentences. Always start strong. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†¬†The last few sentences. Always end strong. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†¬†The scenes of your story.",
"This is why heist movies like the Ocean‚Äôs Eleven franchise explain almost every part of the robbers‚Äô plan before they ever make a move. If you understand their plan to rob the casino, you can experience the same level of frustration, worry, fear, and suspense that the characters feel when their plans go awry. The filmmakers put the audience on Danny Ocean‚Äôs team. They know the plan, so they feel as if they are a part of the heist themselves.",
Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.,
"More precisely, your habits are how you embody your identity.",
"In psychology, this is known as a variable reward.7 fn2 Slot machines are the most common real-world example. A gambler hits the jackpot every now and then but not at any predictable interval. The pace of rewards varies. This variance leads to the greatest spike of dopamine, enhances memory recall, and accelerates habit formation.",
"All five characteristics have biological underpinnings. Extroversion, for instance, can be tracked from birth. If scientists play a loud noise in the nursing ward, some babies turn toward it while others turn away. When the researchers tracked these children through life, they found that the babies who turned toward the noise were more likely to grow up to be extroverts. Those who turned away were more likely to become introverts.",
changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you‚Äôre willing to stick with them for years.,
"The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. ‚ñ† The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner. ‚ñ† The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.",
Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins.,
"Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop.14 Every behavior that is highly habit-forming‚Äîtaking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games, browsing social media‚Äîis associated with higher levels of dopamine.",
"As Machiavelli noted, ‚ÄúMen desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.‚Äù",
"After completing my chart, I analyze it. Specifically, I ask myself three questions: ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†¬†Do any entries appear more than once (the signal of a likely story)? ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†¬†Could I turn any of these entries into useful anecdotes? ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†¬†Could I turn any of these entries into fully realized stories?",
You must end your story on heart. Far too often I hear storytellers attempt to end their story on a laugh. A pun. A joke. A play on words. This is not why we listen to stories. We like to laugh; we want to laugh. But we listen to stories to be moved.,
Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity.,
"Here‚Äôs the punch line: You can break a habit, but you‚Äôre unlikely to forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely‚Äîeven if they go unused for quite a while.",
"When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.",
You don‚Äôt realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or busy) days.,
We imitate the habits of three groups in particular:2 The close. The many. The powerful.,
The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It‚Äôs one thing to say I‚Äôm the type of person who wants this. It‚Äôs something very different to say I‚Äôm the type of person who is this.,
"I know of executives and investors who keep a ‚Äúdecision journal‚Äù in which they record the major decisions they make each week, why they made them, and what they expect the outcome to be. They review their choices at the end of each month or year to see where they were correct and where they went wrong.",
"Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as Premack‚Äôs Principle. Named after the work of professor David Premack, the principle states that ‚Äúmore probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.‚Äù",
"Listen to people in the world tell you stories. Often they start with a sentence like, ‚ÄúThis is hilarious,‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou need to hear this,‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to believe this.‚Äù This is always a mistake, for three reasons. First, it establishes potentially unrealistic expectations.",
"Every story must have an Elephant. The Elephant is the thing that everyone in the room can see. It is large and obvious. It is a clear statement of the need, the want, the problem, the peril, or the mystery. It signifies where the story is headed, and it makes it clear to your audience that this is in fact a story and not a simple musing on a subject.",
"Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. You may want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates, then you‚Äôll continue to be pulled toward spending rather than earning.",
"The Japanese railway system is regarded as one of the best in the world. If you ever find yourself riding a train in Tokyo, you‚Äôll notice that the conductors have a peculiar habit. As each operator runs the train, they proceed through a ritual of pointing at different objects and calling out commands. When the train approaches a signal, the operator will point at it and say, ‚ÄúSignal is green.‚Äù As the train pulls into and out of each station, the operator will point at the speedometer and call out the exact speed. When it‚Äôs time to leave, the operator will point at the timetable and state the time. Out on the platform, other employees are performing similar actions. Before each train departs, staff members will point along the edge of the platform and declare, ‚ÄúAll clear!‚Äù Every detail is identified, pointed at, and named aloud.fn1 This process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works incredibly well. Pointing-and-Calli",
"The French economist Fr√©d√©ric Bastiat explained the problem clearly when he wrote, ‚ÄúIt almost always happens that when the immediate consequence is favorable, the later consequences are disastrous, and vice versa ‚Ä¶.18 Often, the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits.‚Äù",
"I once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair. When asked if it was difficult being confined, he responded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not confined to my wheelchair‚ÄîI am liberated by it.5 If it wasn‚Äôt for my wheelchair, I would be bed-bound and never able to leave my house.‚Äù This shift in perspective completely transformed how he lived each day.",
"The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. In fact, the word identity was originally derived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and identidem, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your ‚Äúrepeated beingness.‚Äù",
"Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat junk food, you feel bad. Watching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don‚Äôt have the energy to do anything else.",
"You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift. For instance, we often talk about everything we have to do in a given day. You have to wake up early for work. You have to make another sales call for your business. You have to cook dinner for your family. Now, imagine changing just one word: You don‚Äôt ‚Äúhave‚Äù to. You ‚Äúget‚Äù to.4 You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales call for your business. You get to cook dinner for your family. By simply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event.",
"The ending of the story ‚Äî your five-second moment ‚Äî will tell you what the beginning of your story should be. The beginning will be the opposite of the end. If my story is about my realization that the world (and especially people) are fundamentally unsafe and willing to hurt you for the pettiest of reasons, the beginning of my story needs to present my previous belief that people are basically good and the world is generally safe.",
"storytelling, deploy Crystal Balls strategically: Only when your prediction seems possible. Only when your guess is reasonable. And only when your prediction presents an intriguing or exciting possibility.",
"Elysha has this consistent, annoying confidence in my abilities. She assumes that I‚Äôm capable of almost anything, which both undermines her appreciation for my abject terror and sets expectations far too high for my liking.",
"The power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits can be easier to change in a new environment.12 It helps to escape the subtle triggers and cues that nudge you toward your current habits. Go to a new place‚Äîa different coffee shop, a bench in the park, a corner of your room you seldom use‚Äîand create a new routine there. It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new habit in the face of competing cues.",
"Everyone said handwashing was important, but few people made a habit out of it. The problem wasn‚Äôt knowledge. The problem was consistency. That was when Luby and his team partnered with Procter & Gamble to supply the neighborhood with Safeguard soap.",
The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.,
"IN THE LATE 1990s, a public health worker named Stephen Luby left his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, and bought a one-way ticket to Karachi, Pakistan.",
Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.,
A stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an environment where habits can easily form.,
"The biggest barrier to positive change at any level‚Äîindividual, team, society‚Äîis identity conflict.",
"In summary, habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and don‚Äôt want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you record another successful instance of your habit. Furthermore, habit tracking provides visual proof that you are casting votes for the type of person you wish to become, which is a delightful form of immediate and intrinsic gratification.",
"What comes naturally to me? For just a moment, ignore what you have been taught. Ignore what society has told you. Ignore what others expect of you. Look inside yourself and ask, ‚ÄúWhat feels natural to me? When have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real me?‚Äù",
"As the psychologist Carl Jung said, ‚ÄúUntil you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.‚Äù",
"Phrases like, ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs a story for another day,‚Äù or ‚ÄúLong story short‚Äù serve to remind our audience that we are telling a story. If your audience knows that you‚Äôre telling a story, then they‚Äôre not time traveling.",
"The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It‚Äôs not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress",
"The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. It‚Äôs easier to practice self-restraint when you don‚Äôt have to use it very often.6 So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment.",
"Even when you know you should start small, it‚Äôs easy to start too big. When you dream about making a change, excitement inevitably takes over and you end up trying to do too much too soon. The most effective way I know to counteract this tendency is to use the Two-Minute Rule, which states, ‚ÄúWhen you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.‚Äù",
"The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.",
"Repeating a habit leads to clear physical changes in the brain. In musicians, the cerebellum‚Äîcritical for physical movements like plucking a guitar string or pulling a violin bow‚Äîis larger than it is in nonmusicians.5 Mathematicians, meanwhile, have increased gray matter in the inferior parietal lobule, which plays a key role in computation and calculation.6 Its size is directly correlated with the amount of time spent in the field; the older and more experienced the mathematician, the greater the increase in gray matter. When scientists analyzed the brains of taxi drivers in London, they found that the hippocampus‚Äîa region of the brain involved in spatial memory‚Äîwas significantly larger in their subjects than in non‚Äìtaxi drivers.7 Even more fascinating, the hippocampus decreased in size when a driver retired. Like the muscles of the body responding to regular weight training, particular regions of the brain adapt as they are used and atrophy as they are abandoned.",
"When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren‚Äôt all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, ‚Äúdisciplined‚Äù people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.",
"Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis. You have to standardize before you can optimize.",
"Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them. The wanting centers in the brain are large: the brain stem, the nucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal striatum, the amygdala, and portions of the prefrontal cortex. By comparison, the liking centers of the brain are much smaller. They are often referred to as ‚Äúhedonic hot spots‚Äù and are distributed like tiny islands throughout the brain.",
"I also suggested this: Can Tim‚Äôs story be about something other than Mount Everest? Can the climb to the summit be about something more personal? More interior? Perhaps a bit of individual growth that resulted from the climb? I know it sounds crazy to turn the summiting of Mount Everest into something other than the summiting of Mount Everest, but if I can turn a story about putting my head through a windshield and dying on the side of the road into a story about my friends taking the place of my family, why not?",
"Simply put, the beginning of the story should be the opposite of the end. Find the opposite of your transformation, revelation, or realization, and this is where your story should start. This is what creates an arc in your story. This is how a story shows change over time. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I was once this, but now I am this. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I once thought this, but now I think this. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I once felt this, but now I feel this.

"Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.",
"IN 1971, AS the Vietnam War was heading into its sixteenth year, congressmen Robert Steele from Connecticut and Morgan Murphy from Illinois made a discovery that stunned the American public. While visiting the troops, they had learned that over 15 percent of U.S. soldiers stationed there were heroin addicts. Follow-up research revealed that 35 percent of service members in Vietnam had tried heroin and as many as 20 percent were addicted‚Äîthe problem was even worse than they had initially thought.1",
"Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. Despite our unique personalities, certain behaviors tend to arise again and again under certain environmental conditions. In church, people tend to talk in whispers. On a dark street, people act wary and guarded. In this way, the most common form of change is not internal, but external: we are changed by the world around us. Every habit is context dependent.",
"Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behavior. We are constantly scanning our environment and wondering, ‚ÄúWhat is everyone else doing?‚Äù We check reviews on Amazon or Yelp or TripAdvisor because we want to imitate the ‚Äúbest‚Äù buying, eating, and travel habits. It‚Äôs usually a smart strategy. There is evidence in numbers.",
Scientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs by measuring a neurotransmitter called dopamine.,
"Dyrsmid began each morning with two jars on his desk. One was filled with 120 paper clips. The other was empty. As soon as he settled in each day, he would make a sales call. Immediately after, he would move one paper clip from the full jar to the empty jar and the process would begin again.",
"Similarly, one study found that the higher your best friend‚Äôs IQ at age eleven or twelve, the higher your IQ would be at age fifteen, even after controlling for natural levels of intelligence.6 We soak up the qualities and practices of those around us.",
"In a finding that completely upended the accepted beliefs about addiction, Robins found that when soldiers who had been heroin users returned home, only 5 percent of them became re-addicted within a year, and just 12 percent relapsed within three years. In other words, approximately nine out of ten soldiers who used heroin in Vietnam eliminated their addiction nearly overnight.3",
"The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit.",
"Behavioral economists refer to this tendency as time inconsistency. That is, the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time.fn2 You value the present more than the future. Usually, this tendency serves us well. A reward that is certain right now is typically worth more than one that is merely possible in the future. But occasionally, our bias toward instant gratification causes problems.",
"Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.",
"There are many ways to prime your environment so it‚Äôs ready for immediate use. If you want to cook a healthy breakfast, place the skillet on the stove, set the cooking spray on the counter, and lay out any plates and utensils you‚Äôll need the night before. When you wake up, making breakfast will be easy. ‚ñ† Want to draw more? Put your pencils, pens, notebooks, and drawing tools on top of your desk, within easy reach. ‚ñ† Want to exercise?

The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.14 You can spot this pattern everywhere.,
"One of the most common questions I hear is, ‚ÄúHow long does it take to build a new habit?‚Äù But what people really should be asking is, ‚ÄúHow many does it take to form a new habit?‚Äù That is, how many repetitions are required to make a habit automatic?",
"The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from LAX adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington, D.C., instead of New York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoff‚Äîthe nose of the airplane moves just a few feet‚Äîbut when magnified across the entire United States, you end up hundreds of miles apart.",
"As Voltaire once wrote, ‚ÄúThe best is the enemy of the good.‚Äù",
"As you explore different options, there are a series of questions you can ask yourself to continually narrow in on the habits and areas that will be most satisfying to you: What feels like fun to me, but work to others? The mark of whether you are made for a task is not whether you love it but whether you can handle the pain of the task easier than most people.",
"Filterblasen gibt es nicht nur in den sozialen Medien. Vier Jahrzehnte Wirtschaftsliberalismus, Sozialabbau und Globalisierung haben die westlichen Gesellschaften so gespalten, dass das reale Leben vieler Menschen sich mittlerweile nur noch in der Filterblase des eigenen Milieus bewegt.

"Die Identit√§tspolitik tut auch hier exakt das Gegenteil. Sie lenkt die Aufmerksamkeit weg von gesellschaftlichen Strukturen und Besitzverh√§ltnissen und richtet sie auf individuelle Eigenschaften wie Ethnie, Hautfarbe oder sexuelle Orientierung. Ging es der traditionellen Linken darum, die Menschen zu ermutigen, ihre Identit√§t vor allem √ºber ihre soziale Stellung zu definieren, also etwa als Arbeiter, sieht die Identit√§tstheorie die wichtigste identit√§tsstiftende Bestimmung des Menschen in Merkmalen, die au√üerhalb und unabh√§ngig von seinem sozialen und gesellschaftlichen Leben existieren.",

Denn Menschen √ºber ihre Hautfarbe oder ihre Abstammung¬†‚Äì nichts anderes ist die Ethnie¬†‚Äì zu definieren, ist durchaus kein neuer Ansatz. Es war von Beginn an, wenn auch mit umgekehrtem Vorzeichen, das Herangehen der extremen Rechten und der Rassenideologie. Von dieser Seite gab es auch schon immer giftige Angriffe auf die Aufkl√§rungsphilosophie. Dass genau das heute als links gilt, ist schon eine bemerkenswerte Umkehrung tradierter Werte.",

"Die gro√üe Rolle, die Fragen der Symbolik und der Sprache im Politikverst√§ndnis des Lifestyle-Linken spielen, h√§ngt sicher auch damit zusammen, dass sich hier ein riesiges Bet√§tigungsfeld er√∂ffnet, auf dem man ungest√∂rt Ver√§nderungen durchsetzen kann, ohne jemals mit einer einflussreichen wirtschaftlichen Interessengruppe in Konflikt zu geraten oder die √∂ffentlichen Kassen relevant zu belasten. Den Mindestlohn zu erh√∂hen oder eine Verm√∂gensteuer f√ºr die oberen Zehntausend einzuf√ºhren ruft nat√ºrlich ungleich mehr Widerstand hervor, als die Beh√∂rdensprache zu ver√§ndern, √ºber Migration als Bereicherung zu reden oder einen weiteren Lehrstuhl f√ºr Gendertheorie einzurichten.",
"Tats√§chlich wurden Unterschiede in Abh√§ngigkeit vom kulturellen und religi√∂sen Kontext der Spieler festgestellt, etwa bei einem Ultimatum-Spiel mit peruanischen Ureinwohnern, das deutlich abweichende Ergebnisse brachte.

"Denn umw√§lzende technologische Ver√§nderungen und grundlegende Innovationen setzten schon immer ein couragiertes Engagement des Staates voraus, weil die Unsicherheit einfach zu gro√ü und der notwendige Zeithorizont zu lang ist, um solche Projekte in einem fr√ºhen Stadium f√ºr private Kapitalgeber attraktiv zu machen.7 Vom siliziumbasierten Halbleiter √ºber das Internet bis zum GPS, von bahnbrechenden medizinischen Neuerungen bis zur Nanotechnologie: Es waren nicht private Unternehmen, sondern staatliche Forschungslabore oder mit dem Geld der Steuerzahler finanzierte Entwicklungsprogramme, denen wir die entscheidenden Durchbr√ºche zu verdanken haben. ¬ªPraktisch jedes Zentrum hochtechnologischer unternehmerischer Aktivit√§t in der heutigen Welt hat seine Wurzeln in proaktiven staatlichen Interventionen¬´, schreibt der Harvard-√ñkonom Josh Lerner.",

"Daraus, dass das √∂konomische Programm vieler rechter Parteien den Interessen von Geringverdienern und √Ñrmeren anscheinend nicht entgegenkommt, wurde vielfach geschlossen, dass die Rechte prim√§r aus kulturellen und nicht aus sozial√∂konomischen Motiven gew√§hlt wird. Oft wird argumentiert, dass die fr√ºhere W√§hlerschaft der Sozialdemokratie zwar sozial√∂konomisch unver√§ndert links orientiert ist, sich also eine Politik f√ºr mehr sozialen Ausgleich und bessere soziale Absicherungen w√ºnschen w√ºrde, dass aber die betreffenden sozialen Schichten kulturell eher traditionalistisch oder wertkonservativ seien, also hoher Zuwanderung oder allzu weitreichenden Rechten f√ºr Minderheiten skeptisch gegen√ºberstehen.",
"Eine Mikroaggression muss kein beleidigendes Wort sein und die Herabsetzung muss auch nicht in der Absicht des Sprechers liegen. Es gen√ºgt, wenn ein Angeh√∂riger einer Minderheit etwas in den falschen Hals bekommt.

"Zun√§chst muss man festhalten: Kapitalistisches Wirtschaften war noch nie per se innovativ. Sein eigentlicher Antrieb ist, aus Geld mehr Geld zu machen. Dieses Motiv kann Anreize f√ºr Innovation, h√∂here Produktivit√§t und technologischen Wandel setzen, muss es aber nicht. Genau besehen f√∂rdert der Profittrieb den technologischen Fortschritt und den allgemeinen Wohlstand nur unter ziemlich engen Bedingungen. Entscheidend ist, dass es f√ºr Firmen m√∂glichst keinen anderen Weg der Kostensenkung gibt als den Einsatz neuer Technologien und dass ihr einziges Mittel, h√∂here Preise durchzusetzen, darin besteht, bessere, innovative Produkte auf den Markt zu bringen. Nur wenn beides zutrifft,",
"War die urspr√ºngliche Idee des Patents, Innovation zu belohnen, indem sie √ºber eine gewisse Zeit gesch√ºtzt wird, bewirkt es mittlerweile das Gegenteil: Da keineswegs nur echte Neuerungen patentiert werden k√∂nnen, sind viele gro√üe Firmen dazu √ºbergegangen, sich gro√üe Patentpools anzulegen, die vor allem dazu dienen, Innovation bei ihren Wettbewerbern zu behindern. Bereits 2003 hatte das Fraunhofer-Institut f√ºr Systemtechnik und Innovationsforschung eine Studie unter dem bezeichnenden Titel ¬ªErfindungen contra Patente¬´ vorgestellt. Sie kommt zu dem Schluss, dass ein immer gr√∂√üerer Teil der Patentanmeldungen dem destruktiven Ziel dient, die Anwendung und Weiterentwicklung innovativer Technologien durch Konkurrenten zu blockieren.3 Obwohl das Problem also seit fast 20 Jahren bekannt ist, hat sich nichts ver√§ndert.¬†",

Erst 1974 gelang es der Nelkenrevolution, die in Portugal seit 1926 herrschende Milit√§rjunta wegzufegen. Die ersten freien Wahlen in Spanien nach dem Sturz des Franco-Regimes fanden 1977 statt.

"Der britische Entwicklungsforscher Paul Collier hat untersucht, welchen Einfluss kulturelle Identit√§t auf die Zusammenarbeit in d√∂rflichen Gemeinschaften afrikanischer L√§nder hat.

"Es ist ein echtes Problem vieler afrikanischer Staaten, dass bis heute Stammesloyalit√§ten dominieren und es gesamtstaatlich kaum eine oder gar keine gemeinsame Identit√§t gibt.

"Wenn dagegen Einwanderer und Einheimische einander nicht mehr n√§herkommen, sondern die verschiedenen Milieus sich voneinander entfernen, wenn gemeinsame Erlebnisse, Freundschaften und Ehen zwischen ihnen seltener statt h√§ufiger werden, dann wachsen Ablehnung, Ressentiment und Feindseligkeit.

"Noch klarer ist die Interessenvertretung f√ºr die kleinen Leute etwa bei der polnischen Rechten. W√§hrend die Parteien, die in Polen unter dem Label links firmierten, einem Wildwest-Kapitalismus mit extremer Ungleichheit den Boden bereitet hatten, beschloss die viel gescholtene PiS nach ihrem Wahlsieg 2015 das gr√∂√üte Sozialprogramm der j√ºngeren polnischen Geschichte. Dazu geh√∂rte als wichtigste Ma√ünahme ein Kindergeld von 500‚ÄØZloty pro Monat, umgerechnet rund 120‚ÄØEuro, eine mit Blick auf das polnische Pro-Kopf-Einkommen gewaltige Summe.

"Wenn wir √ºber Linksliberalismus reden, reden wir also nicht √ºber den Kampf um die rechtliche Gleichstellung von Minderheiten, sondern √ºber die Forderung nach Privilegierung von Minderheiten. Wir reden nicht √ºber das Ringen um Gleichheit, sondern √ºber die Heiligsprechung von Ungleichheit.",
"In other words, should the Left not enact the anti-austerity measures that the populist Right is enacting, just without the accompanying racist-nationalist baggage? ‚ÄúLogical‚Äù as it may sound, this, precisely, is what cannot be done: the Right can do it precisely because its anti-austerity measures are accompanied by racist-nationalist ideology; this ideological coating is what makes anti-austerity acceptable.",

"Mit dem Gefangenendilemma wird auch begr√ºndet, warum Gemeing√ºter angeblich nicht dauerhaft bestehen k√∂nnen. Wie im oben beschriebenen Beispiel vom See: Jeder Angler wei√ü, dass es schlecht ist, den See leer zu fischen. Aber da jeder zugleich damit rechnen muss, dass bei eigener Zur√ºckhaltung andere den Reibach machen und das den Fischbestand genauso ruiniert, werden sich alle verantwortungslos bedienen, bis keine Forelle mehr durchs glitzernde Gew√§sser schwimmt. Deshalb pl√§diert diese √∂konomische Schule f√ºr die Privatisierung von Gemeing√ºtern. Wenn der See nur noch einem geh√∂rt¬†‚Äì so die Annahme ‚Äì, hat der dann auch ein Interesse, auf nachhaltige Fangquoten zu achten.",
"Der dritte fundamentale Unterschied betrifft die Wertsch√§tzung von Rationalit√§t und Vernunft. Stand die traditionelle Linke in der Tradition der Aufkl√§rung und setzte auf die Kraft rationaler Argumente, auch in dem Selbstbewusstsein, im Vergleich zur gesellschaftlichen Rechten die besseren zu haben, begr√§bt die Identit√§tspolitik den Anspruch, eine rationale Debatte auch nur f√ºhren zu k√∂nnen, und √ºberh√∂ht diffuse Empfindungen und mimosenhaftes Beleidigtsein.",
"Die schlichte Wahrheit ist: Es gibt kein gemeinsames Interesse der Nachfahren von Einwanderern aus muslimischen L√§ndern oder der Homosexuellen oder gar der Frauen, das √ºber die rechtliche Gleichstellung und generelle Nichtdiskriminierung hinausgeht.

"Statt kleiner zu werden, vergr√∂√üerte sich so der Abstand zwischen Einheimischen und Zugewanderten. Viele Nachkommen t√ºrkischer Einwanderer in Deutschland sprechen heute schlechter Deutsch als die Kinder der ¬ªGastarbeiter¬´, die in den sechziger Jahren gekommen waren. Die zunehmende Spaltung zeigt sich auch an Details. In Frankreich ist die zweite Generation muslimischer Einwanderer weniger als die erste bereit, ihre Kinder in Schulkantinen essen zu lassen. In Gro√übritannien tragen immer mehr Frauen mit Vorfahren aus Bangladesch einen Schleier, obwohl das in Bangladesch gar nicht √ºblich ist. An diesem Beispiel wird auch klar, dass das Anliegen gar nicht darin besteht, an Br√§uchen und Traditionen der Herkunft festzuhalten, sondern die Praktiken ausdr√ºcklich dazu dienen, sich von der einheimischen Bev√∂lkerung abzugrenzen.",
"Den Zusammenhang von Migration und Lohndumping auch nur anzusprechen gilt im linksliberalen Mainstream heute als unanst√§ndig.

"Was von Zuwanderern erwartet werden kann, ist daher nicht, dass sie so denken und f√ºhlen, als w√§ren sie in dem betreffenden Land geboren, sondern die Bereitschaft, sich auf die Mehrheitskultur und deren Werte einzulassen, ihren Fundus an Gemeinsamkeiten zu respektieren und zu beginnen, sich selbst als B√ºrger des Staates, in dem sie ihr Leben verbringen wollen, zu verstehen.",
"Sehr lesenswert in diesem Zusammenhang ist eine Studie √ºber politische Entscheidungen in Deutschland in den Jahren 1998 bis 2015.

Wenn eine rechte Partei bessere soziale Absicherungen und eine Abkehr vom Wirtschaftsliberalismus fordert, wie Le Pens Rassemblement National, oder wenn sie bereits Sozialprogramme umgesetzt hat, wie die polnische PiS, ist das Gef√§lle noch gr√∂√üer: Dann werden die Rechten noch st√§rker vor allem von den Benachteiligten, den Arbeitern und der abstiegsbedrohten unteren Mitte gew√§hlt.",

The Chinese harvest in 1960 was smaller than planned because of a bad season combined with poor governmental advice about how to grow crops more effectively. The local governments didn‚Äôt want to show bad results, so they took all the food and sent it to the central government. There was no food left.

Under the current US system, rich, insured patients visit doctors more than they need, running up costs, while poor patients cannot afford even simple, inexpensive treatments and die younger than they should.

By doing that, they achieve the opposite of what they intend to do.

The slip-box not only provides us with the opportunity to learn in this proven way, it forces us to do exactly what is recommended just by using it. We have to elaborate on what we read just to be able to write it down and translate it into different contexts. We retrieve information from the slip-box whenever we try to connect new notes with old notes. Just by doing this, we mix up contexts, shuffle notes and retrieve the information in irregular intervals.

"In a small but fascinating study, two psychologists tried to find out if it made a difference if students in a lecture took notes by hand or by typing them into their laptops (Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014). They were not able to find any difference in terms of the number of facts the students were able to remember. But in terms of understanding the content of the lecture, the students who took their notes by hand came out much, much better. After a week, this difference in understanding was still clearly measurable. There is no secret to it and the explanation is pretty simple: Handwriting is slower and can‚Äôt be corrected as quickly as electronic notes. Because students can‚Äôt write fast enough to keep up with everything that is said in a lecture, they are forced to focus on the gist of what is being said, not the details. But to be able to note down the gist of a lecture, you have to understand it in the first place.",
"One inconvenient truth in the end: The planning skills of students are pathetic.

Interestingly, the majority of the student‚Äôs ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù estimates were not so different from their estimates for writing under perfect conditions. This alone should have given them pause for thought. But when the researchers checked how much time the students really needed, it was much, much longer than they estimated. Not even half of the students managed to finish their papers in the time they thought they would need under the worst possible conditions (Buehler, Griffin and Ross 1994). The researchers did not assume that half of the students suddenly faced calamities bey",
"Zeigarnik successfully reproduced what is now known as the Zeigarnik effect: Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory ‚Äì until they are done.

Then you artificially create a conflict of interest between getting things done (finding support for your preconceived argument) and generating insight, turning any departure from your preconceived plan into a mutiny against the success of your own project. This is a good rule of thumb: If insight becomes a threat to your academic or writing success, you are doing it wrong. Developing",

During World War II, he was asked to help the Royal Air Force find the areas on their planes that were most often hit by bullets so they could cover them with more armour. But instead of counting the bullet holes on the returned planes, he recommended armouring the spots where none of the planes had taken any hits.

"The moment we stop making plans is the moment we start to learn. It is a matter of practice to become good at generating insight and write good texts by choosing and moving flexibly between the most important and promising tasks, judged by nothing else than the circumstances of the given situation.

We might have felt a bit insecure in the first moment, but at the same time, it became obvious that we would never have learned to bicycle if we left the training wheels on. The only thing we would have learned is to ride a bike with training wheels on.",
"Psychologists used to associate scientific work exclusively with focused attention, while other, more floating kinds of attention were exclusively associated with creative work like art. We know today that we need both kinds of attention for art and science. It is not surprising, therefore, that this flexibility can be found among most, if not all, exceptional scientists. Oshin Vartanian compared and analysed the daily workflows of Nobel Prize winners and other eminent scientists and concluded that it is not a relentless focus, but flexible focus that distinguishes them. ‚ÄúSpecifically, the problem-solving behavior of eminent scientists can alternate between extraordinary levels of focus on specific concepts and playful exploration of ideas. This suggests that successful problem solving may be a function of flexible strategy application in relation to task demands.‚Äù (Vartanian 2009, 57) These studies help to solve a puzzle that has bothered psychologists who study creative people as wel",
"Outlining or changing the outline is also a very different task that requires a very different focus on something else: not on one thought, but on the whole argument. It is important, though, to understand outlining not as the preparation of writing or even as planning, but as a separate task we need to return to throughout the writing process on a regular basis. We need a structure all the time, but as we work our way bottom-up, it is bound to change often. And whenever we need to update the structure, we need to take a step back, look at the big picture and change it accordingly.",

Even the best scientists and thinkers are not free from it. What sets them apart is the mere fact that they are aware of the problem and do something about it. The classic role model would be Charles Darwin. He forced himself to write down (and therefore elaborate on) the arguments that were the most critical of his theories. ‚ÄúI had [...] during many years followed a golden rule, namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought came across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a memorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from the memory than favorable",

When he came up with an idea to circumvent the congested roads, it was a simple one. He had no clue that it would tip the world in a new direction. He did not foresee that his simple idea would reshape the political landscape, let some nations rise to the top and other fall behind, make century-old professions redundant, give birth to new industries, and would barely leave a single person on earth unaffected by it.

"Most often, innovation is not the result of a sudden moment of realization, anyway, but incremental steps toward improvement. Even groundbreaking paradigm shifts are most often the consequence of many small moves in the right direction instead of one big idea. This is why the search for small differences is key.

"Ironically, it is therefore often the highly gifted and talented students, who receive a lot of praise, who are more in danger of developing a fixed mindset and getting stuck. Having been praised for what they are (talented and gifted) rather than for what they do, they tend to focus on keeping this impression intact, rather than exposing themselves to new challenges and the possibility of learning from failure.

"Thinking and creativity can flourish under restricted conditions and there are plenty of studies to back that claim (cf. Stokes 2001; Rheinberger 1997). The scientific revolution started with the standardization and controlling of experiments, which made them comparable and repeatable (cf. Shapin, 1996). Or think of poetry: It imposes restrictions in terms of rhythm, syllables or rhymes. Haikus give the poet very little room for formal variations, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they are equally limited in terms of poetic expressiveness. On the contrary: It is the strict formalism that allows them to transcend time and culture. Language in itself is extremely standardised and limited in many ways.

"Conversely, we can use the Zeigarnik effect to our advantage by deliberately keeping unanswered questions in our mind. We can ruminate about them, even when we do something that has nothing to do with work and ideally does not require our full attention. Letting thoughts linger without focusing on them gives our brains the opportunity to deal with problems in a different, often surprisingly productive way. While we have a walk or a shower or clean the house, the brain cannot help but play around with the last unsolved problem it came across.

How much credit does a person deserve for not being lazy? None at all. Laziness, like diligence, is a neurological condition. Of course, conservatives are right to think that we must encourage people to work to the best of their abilities and discourage free riders wherever we can. And it is wise to hold people responsible for their actions when doing so influences their behavior and brings benefit to society. But this does not mean that we must be taken in by the illusion of free will.",

"The science of learning is still undecided on the question of whether we all share Shereshevsky‚Äôs ability to memorise virtually everything we ever have encountered, but are only better at suppressing it. After all, sometimes we suddenly remember scenes from the past in great detail, triggered by a cue like the scent of a madeleine in Proust‚Äôs recherche. These moments of involuntary memory might be like small cracks in the mental barrier through which we can catch a glimpse of all the memories we have collected over our lifetimes, but might never again have access to. Forgetting, then, would not be the loss of a memory, but the erection of a mental barrier between the conscious mind and our long-term memory. Psychologists call this mechanism active inhibition (cf. MacLeod, 2007). It is easy to understand what it is good for: Without a very thorough filter, our brains would constantly be flooded by memories, making it impossible to focus on anything in our surroundings.",
"The educational psychologist Kirsti Lonka compared the reading approach of unusually successful doctoral candidates and students with those who were much less successful. One difference stood out as critical: The ability to think beyond the given frames of a text (Lonka 2003, 155f). Experienced academic readers usually read a text with questions in mind and try to relate it to other possible approaches, while inexperienced readers tend to adopt the question of a text and the frames of the argument and take it as a given. What good readers can do is spot the limitations of a particular approach and see what is not mentioned in the text.",
"The slip-box not only confronts us with dis-confirming information, but also helps with what is known as the feature-positive effect (Allison and Messick 1988; Newman, Wolff, and Hearst 1980; Sainsbury 1971). This is the phenomenon in which we tend to overstate the importance of information that is (mentally) easily available to us and tilts our thinking towards the most recently acquired facts, not necessarily the most relevant ones.",
mere-exposure effect: doing something many times makes us believe we have become good at it ‚Äì completely independent of our actual performance (Bornstein 1989). We unfortunately tend to confuse familiarity with skill.,
"Our short-term memory is also limited. We need strategies not to waste its capacity with thoughts we can better delegate to an external system. While the estimations of our long-term memory capacity are wildly diverse and rather speculative, psychologists used to tend to agree on a very specific number when it came to short-term memory: We can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the same time, plus/minus two (Miller 1956).",
"Make permanent notes. Now turn to your slip-box. Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests. This can soon be done by looking into the slip-box ‚Äì it only contains what interests you anyway.",
"The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering.",
"Most notes will be found through other notes. The organisation of the notes is in the network of references in the slip-box, so all we need from the index are entry points. A few wisely chosen notes are sufficient for each entry point. The quicker we get from the index to the concrete notes, the quicker we move our attention from mentally preconceived ideas towards the fact-rich level of interconnected content, where we can conduct a fact-based dialogue with the slip-box.",
"The fact that too much order can impede learning has become more and more known (Carey 2014). Conversely, we know that the deliberate creation of variations and contrasts can facilitate learning. Nate Kornell and Bjork showed this when they experimentally taught students different art styles. First, they used the traditional approach of showing students one art style at a time using different paintings. Then, they deliberately mixed up the styles and shuffled the paintings around. The students who were presented paintings from different styles in no particular order learned to distinguish styles faster and were also much more successful at matching paintings to styles and artists they had never seen before.",
"Make literature notes. Whenever you read something, make notes about the content. Write down what you don‚Äôt want to forget or think you might use in your own thinking or writing.

Keep these notes together with the bibliographic details in one place ‚Äì your reference system.",
"Our brains just love routines. Before new information prompts our brains to think differently about something, they make the new information fit into the known or let it disappear completely from our perception. Usually, we don‚Äôt even notice when our brains modify our surroundings to make it fit its expectations. We need therefore a bit of a ruse to break the power of thinking routines.",
"Learning would be not so much about saving information, like on a hard disk, but about building connections and bridges between pieces of information to circumvent the inhibition mechanism in the right moment. It is about making sure that the right ‚Äúcues‚Äù trigger the right memory, about how we can think strategically to remember the most useful information when we need it. This is far from self-evident. If we look at the current state of education, especially the learning strategies most students employ, we see that the vast majority of all learning still aims to improve ‚Äústorage strength,‚Äù even though it cannot be improved. It is still mostly about remembering isolated facts and not so much about building connections.",
Many people worry that free will is a necessary illusion‚Äîand that without it we will fail to live creative and fulfilling lives. This concern isn‚Äôt entirely unjustified. One study found that having subjects read an argument against the existence of free will made them more likely to cheat on a subsequent exam.19 Another found such subjects to be less helpful and more aggressive.,
"If a man‚Äôs choice to shoot the president is determined by a certain pattern of neural activity, which is in turn the product of prior causes‚Äîperhaps an unfortunate coincidence of bad genes, an unhappy childhood, lost sleep, and cosmic-ray bombardment‚Äîwhat can it possibly mean to say that his will is ‚Äúfree‚Äù?",
Another lab extended this work using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI): Subjects were asked to press one of two buttons while watching a ‚Äúclock‚Äù composed of a random sequence of letters appearing on a screen. They reported which letter was visible at the moment they decided to press one button or the other. The experimenters found two brain regions that contained information about which button subjects would press a full 7 to 10 seconds before the decision was consciously made.,
"What we condemn most in another person is the conscious intention to do harm. Degrees of guilt can still be judged by reference to the facts of a case: the personality of the accused, his prior offenses, his patterns of association with others, his use of intoxicants, his confessed motives with regard to the victim, etc. If a person‚Äôs actions seem to have been entirely out of character, this might influence our view of the risk he now poses to others. If the accused appears unrepentant and eager to kill again, we need entertain no notions of free will to consider him a danger to society.",
such a state of mind always desirable? Probably not.,
"Decisions, intentions, efforts, goals, willpower, etc., are causal states of the brain, leading to specific behaviors, and behaviors lead to outcomes in the world. Human choice, therefore, is as important as fanciers of free will believe. But the next choice you make will come out of the darkness of prior causes that you, the conscious witness of your experience, did not bring into being.",
"Becoming sensitive to the background causes of one‚Äôs thoughts and feelings can‚Äîparadoxically‚Äîallow for greater creative control over one‚Äôs life. It is one thing to bicker with your wife because you are in a bad mood; it is another to realize that your mood and behavior have been caused by low blood sugar. This understanding reveals you to be a biochemical puppet, of course, but it also allows you to grab hold of one of your strings: A bite of food may be all that your personality requires. Getting behind our conscious thoughts and feelings can allow us to steer a more intelligent course through our lives (while knowing, of course, that we are ultimately being steered).",
"Your body is doing these things, of course, but if it ‚Äúdecided‚Äù to do otherwise, you would be the victim of these changes, rather than their cause. To say that you are responsible for everything that goes on inside your skin because it‚Äôs all ‚Äúyou‚Äù is to make a claim that bears absolutely no relationship to the feelings of agency and moral responsibility that have made the idea of free will an enduring problem for philosophy.",
"The phrase ‚Äúfree will‚Äù describes what it feels like to identify with certain mental states as they arise in consciousness. Thoughts like ‚ÄúWhat should I get my daughter for her birthday?

But from a deeper perspective (speaking both objectively and subjectively), thoughts simply arise unauthored and yet author our actions.",
"The sound of the leaf blower intrudes, but I can seize the spotlight of my attention in the next moment and aim it elsewhere. This difference between nonvolitional and volitional states of mind is reflected at the level of the brain‚Äîfor they are governed by different systems.

"If you want a second scoop of ice cream and no one is forcing you to eat it, then eating a second scoop is fully demonstrative of your freedom of will. The truth, however, is that people claim greater autonomy than this. Our moral intuitions and sense of personal agency are anchored to a felt sense that we are the conscious source of our thoughts and actions.",
"To say that I was responsible for my behavior is simply to say that what I did was sufficiently in keeping with my thoughts, intentions, beliefs, and desires to be considered an extension of them. If I had found myself standing in the market naked, intent upon stealing as many tins of anchovies as I could carry, my behavior would be totally out of character; I would feel that I was not in my right mind, or that I was otherwise not responsible for my actions.",
And there is no way I can influence my desires‚Äîfor what tools of influence would I use? Other desires? To say that I would have done otherwise had I wanted to is simply to say that I would have lived in a different universe had I been in a different universe. Compatibilism amounts to nothing more than an assertion of the following creed: A puppet is free as long as he loves his strings.,
"Not only are we not as free as we think we are‚Äîwe do not feel as free as we think we do. Our sense of our own freedom results from our not paying close attention to what it is like to be us. The moment we pay attention, it is possible to see that free will is nowhere to be found, and our experience is perfectly compatible with this truth.",
"Even if you believe that every human being harbors an immortal soul, the problem of responsibility remains: I cannot take credit for the fact that I do not have the soul of a psychopath. If I had truly been in Komisarjevsky‚Äôs shoes on July 23, 2007‚Äîthat is, if I had his genes and life experience and an identical brain (or soul) in an identical state‚ÄîI would have acted exactly as he did. There is simply no intellectually respectable position from which to deny this. The role of luck, therefore, appears decisive. Of course, if we learned that both these men had been suffering from brain tumors that explained their violent behavior, our moral intuitions would shift dramatically. But a neurological disorder appears to be just a special case of physical events giving rise to thoughts and actions. Understanding the neurophysiology of the brain, therefore, would seem to be as exculpatory as finding a tumor in it. How can we make sense of our lives, and hold people accountable for their choice",
"Clearly, vengeance answers to a powerful psychological need in many of us. We are deeply disposed to perceive people as the authors of their actions, to hold them responsible for the wrongs they do us, and to feel that these transgressions must be punished.",
"We know, in fact, that we sometimes feel responsible for events over which we have no causal influence. Given the right experimental manipulations, people can be led to believe that they consciously intended an action when they neither chose it nor had control over their movements. In one experiment, subjects were asked to select pictures on a screen using a computer‚Äôs cursor. They tended to believe that they had intentionally guided the cursor to a specific image even when it was under the full control of another person, as long as they heard the name of the image just before the cursor stopped.12 People who are susceptible to hypnosis can be given elaborate suggestions to perform odd tasks, and when asked why they have done these things, many will confabulate‚Äîgiving reasons for their behavior that have nothing to do with its actual cause.",

"How can we be ‚Äúfree‚Äù as conscious agents if everything that we consciously intend is caused by events in our brain that we do not intend and of which we are entirely unaware? We can‚Äôt. To say that ‚Äúmy brain‚Äù decided to think or act in a particular way, whether consciously or not, and that this is the basis for my freedom, is to ignore the very source of our belief in free will: the feeling of conscious agency. People feel that they are the authors of their thoughts and actions, and this is the only reason why there seems to be a problem of free will worth talking about.",
One fact now seems indisputable: Some moments before you are aware of what you will do next‚Äîa time in which you subjectively appear to have complete freedom to behave however you please‚Äîyour brain has already determined what you will do.

"There is a distinction between voluntary and involuntary actions, of course, but it does nothing to support the common idea of free will (nor does it depend upon it). A voluntary action is accompanied by the felt intention to carry it out, whereas an involuntary action isn‚Äôt. Needless to say, this difference is reflected at the level of the brain. And what a person consciously intends to do says a lot about him. It makes sense to treat a man who enjoys murdering children differently from one who accidentally hit and killed a child with his car‚Äîbecause the conscious intentions of the former give us a lot of information about how he is likely to behave in the future.",

"Though they look the same, van Marken Lichtenbelt figured that Wim‚Äôs near-constant exposure to the cold would result in his having a much greater amount of BAT than his twin would. But when the professor put both Wim and Andr√© into a PET/CT scan, he found that they‚Äîremarkably‚Äîhad very similar (high) levels of BAT. Even so, despite their similar biology, Wim‚Äôs ability to withstand the cold is undoubtedly stronger than his brother‚Äôs. While BAT likely plays a part in his metabolic robustness, defining the exact underlying mechanisms proves to be a deceptively difficult task.",
"The brain then has a few potential options to deal with this information. It can simply ignore the signal and calculate that the body‚Äôs stores of white fat provide sufficient insulation, and because the brain perceives no real threat it does nothing. Or the brain can trigger various muscles to start shivering and mechanically heat the body. Or it can ramp up the metabolism and tell brown fat to start sucking white fat out of storage and burn it for heat energy. Or it can decide to do a mix of all three.",
I begin with three rounds of power breathing followed by a breath-hold with no air in my lungs. Then I take a 15-second half-lung recovery breath and start the next round.

"In Wim‚Äôs terminology, breath-out exercises primarily work on the sympathetic nervous system‚Äîthe fight-or-flight responses. Breath-in exercises first trigger parasympathetic responses and might make a person more inclined to relax before the sympathetic responses kick in.",
"While you‚Äôre in this moment of shock and pain, you have two basic goals. First, you need to control your breathing and keep calm. The sensations that most closely match the feeling of burning will dissipate if you focus your mind on the pain. Try to relax instead of tightly clenching up every muscle.

Hamilton‚Äôs lungs might burn and his body might be brutalized by the swirl around him. ‚ÄúBut at some point,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúif you make it far enough, the grip will loosen. You have to keep your mind still while you are in the midst of it all, knowing that your chance will come.‚Äù And when it does let up, Hamilton taps into all of the stored up energy in his body to make his move.

So far, he‚Äôs made it back alive every time.",
"His studies aim to understand the way that the environment alters the body. While pharmaceuticals might be able to target specific bodily processes and tweak them to treat a specific acute ailment, van Marken Licktenbelt sees the twin epidemics of diabetes and obesity through a thermodynamic lens. Both conditions come from there being too much energy available for the body. When there‚Äôs too much energy in a system, then that system starts to malfunction. It‚Äôs a matter of physics. And there are really only three ways to fix it: You can reduce the amount of energy coming into the body, decrease the body‚Äôs efficiency of absorbing energy, or increase the rate that the body makes use of it.",

Rule of thumb: Keep having conversations until you stop hearing new stuff.,
"There‚Äôs an entire hidden physiology in our bodies that operates on evolutionary programming most of us make no attempt to unlock.

"Once you‚Äôre already cold, clench the muscles in your feet and hands and then sequentially tighten every muscle above them.

"Your body will quickly deplete the oxygen stores available in the lungs and have to rely solely on what is available in the bloodstream. When you get close to needing to gasp, you can extend your limits in two ways. The first is the same as with basic breathing, slowly letting out what is left of the air in your lungs. The second method will become critical later for controlling vasoconstriction. It consists of a rolling set of muscle contractions that you start at your feet and sequentially tighten until you reach up to your head.",

"But that‚Äôs not all. In addition to mitochondria, scientists estimate you have more than 10 trillion other microbes in your body, comprising more than 10,000 different species, and accounting for 1 to 3 percent of your body weight. Billions more live on your skin, eyes, hair, and in your blood.",
"Under perfect circumstances where your first guesses are mostly correct and you‚Äôre in a relatively simple industry that you already understand, then you it might only take 3-5 conversations to confirm what you already believe. But you usually won‚Äôt get so lucky, and it will take quite a few more until you start hearing a consistent message from the folks you‚Äôre talking to. If you‚Äôve run more than 10 conversations and are still getting results that are all over the map, then it‚Äôs possible that your customer segment is too vague, which means you‚Äôre mashing together feedback from multiple different types of customers.",
"The first task was to understand exactly how BAT works. Since it was only recently discovered in humans, many of the basic mechanics were still a little hazy. But the broad strokes of the process seemed fairly simple. Once nerve cells in the skin detect a cold environment, they relay a chemical signal through a series of neurons leading to the autonomic centers in the brain with a message to get ready to start heating the body.",
"three basic techniques: cold exposure in the snow, focused third-eye meditation, and sequential muscle retention after hyperventilation.",
"As Galen Strawson, author and professor of philosophy at the University of Texas, astutely pointed out in his May 2016 article for the New York Times that German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz described this disconnect quite vividly all the way back in 1714. Consciousness is ‚Äúinexplicable on mechanical principles, i.e., by shapes and movements,‚Äù Leibniz wrote. ‚ÄúIf we imagine a machine whose structure makes it think, sense, and be conscious, we can conceive of it being enlarged in such a way that we can go inside it like a mill. Suppose we do: visiting its insides, we will never find anything but parts pushing each other‚Äînever anything that could explain a conscious state.‚Äù",
"It‚Äôs strange to think about how quickly a human sense can disappear when it falls into disuse. Even when it is the most defining characteristic of a person, simply not exercising the neural muscle over a short time can make someone entirely dependent on external resources. While digital maps are a fairly recent phenomenon, there are other much more fundamental biological abilities that have simply vanished from our everyday use altogether. They lie there dormant and unused until the right stimulus wakes them up.",
"Under normal circumstances, once the immune system detects E. coli it starts to produce antibodies and mounts an aggressive fever response to stop the infection before it spreads. People whose immune systems are already compromised, such as by a drug or sickness, continue on as if nothing happened. So the test he devised for Hof was simple: He‚Äôd inject him with the dead bacteria and see how he responded. As I mentioned in Chapter 1, when the team injected the solution into Hof‚Äôs bloodstream he showed almost no reaction at all‚Äîa result that astounded the scientists and helped earn Kox an award for his PhD dissertation on anti-inflammatory pathways.",
"Brown fat is a fundamental tissue in mammals that, at the time, was mostly understood as something that rodents used to help heat themselves during hibernation. The spongy, fatty tissue looks a lot like ordinary white fat that most mammals use to store excess caloric energy. But where white fat can serve as an insulator, brown fat has an active role to burn white fat to generate body heat.",
"In reality, our customer segment was just too broad. We were trying to serve everyone simultaneously. We said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to every request. Every debate over a new feature could be won by claiming, ‚ÄúWell, those guys would love it.‚Äù The reverse argument could be made to prevent any feature‚Äôs removal.",
"Like many things with the Wim Hof Method, it‚Äôs something that is easier to feel and experience than it is to describe in words. Hyperventilation decreases CO2 and increases overall oxygen in the bloodstream while moving blood pH from acidic to alkaline. During retention (with lungs full of air) you sequentially tighten all the muscles from your extremities toward the place where you want to move the blood supply. The process is a little bit like wringing out a wet rag from one end to another and pushing the water out. It‚Äôs hard to say exactly what you‚Äôre physically moving inside the brain when you‚Äôre targeting a headache; perhaps it‚Äôs the smooth muscles in its vasculature, or perhaps you‚Äôre just thinking at a particular spot. In my experience, after a few seconds of using this method minor headaches vanish and major ones decrease their intensity.",
"To keep the core warm, the muscles that control the arteries clench tightly and restrict the flow of blood only to vital areas. The process is known as vasoconstriction.",
"The brain burns far more energy than any other part of the body. In a typical day an adult male burns 2,200 calories, but the brain gobbles up 15 to 20 percent of that energy. To put this into context: If you charge up all 1,576 stairs from the ground floor to the observation deck of the Empire State Building, your muscles will burn only 54 calories, which is roughly the equivalent of a single Oreo cookie. (This is not to say that going up all those flights of stairs won‚Äôt burn calories, but most of the additional energy actually stems from increased circulation and heart rate.) If you can turn down even a few of the brain‚Äôs higher functions, you will see a vast improvement in your ability to hold your breath. And there is no better tool to dissect and modulate the inner workings of the mind than meditation.",
"But there‚Äôs a third group of muscles and reactions that are shared between the autonomic and somatic systems. Any one of us can decide to take a breath or blink our eyes, but if we let our minds wander, some deep part of our nervous system takes over. If you want to, you can hijack control away from some automatic processes with a thought, but when your mind drifts away, they continue on their own. This is a good thing: With such a system there‚Äôs no way that you can simply forget to breathe.",
"To stave off hypothermia, the body conserves heat by shutting off blood supply to the extremities. When this happens, miles of vestibular roadways squinch closed, keeping most of the blood in the body‚Äôs core and letting the vital organs relax in a warm blood cocoon while temperatures in the hands, feet, ears, and nose plummet.",
One of the goals of this practice is to shut down the higher cognitive functions so that you can communicate directly with your lower brain functions.,
"To some degree there have always been people who have straddled the line between biology and technology. In ancient Sparta, soldier-scholars wore only simple red cloaks and no shoes, regardless of the weather. They believed exposure made them fiercer in battle and immune to the ravages of the outside world.",
"different breathing routines target different aspects of the nervous system. The basic breathing technique of holding your breath after hyperventilating acts mostly on parasympathetic nerves. The sympathetic system only starts to kick in closer to the moment when you are struggling to stop yourself from gasping, and it is often best to train with breath-out holds. Breath-in holds are better for getting to your absolute maximum number of pushups or retention duration, but are less efficient at cracking into your nervous system.",
The easiest way for an adult to rapidly increase their core temperature is through shivering. The activity of muscles generates a moderate amount of heat as a byproduct of movement.,
"There are also muscles that we have almost no control over whatsoever. These include muscles that control the pace of the heart, the motion of the vascular system, the speed of digestion, and the dilation of our pupils. All of these are part of the autonomic nervous system‚Äîthe body‚Äôs version of autopilot.",
"Once you feel reasonably calm, the second thing you need to master is suppressing your impulse to shiver. After the initial shock of the cold recedes, your body will soon click on an instinctual program to warm itself through muscle movement. It‚Äôs up to you to keep that at bay. Shivering will certainly use up a lot of calories, and for this reason it can be useful if you want to lose weight. But your goal here is to command your nervous system to submit to your will. If your body can‚Äôt shiver itself warm again or rely on the insulating properties of your white fat, its only remaining option is to start ramping up your metabolism. This is to say, you will begin passively generating brown fat and building up your stores of mitochondria if you can suppress your shiver response.",
"The autonomic nervous system divides itself into two interrelated components. First is the sympathetic nervous system, which controls the so-called fight-or-flight response. If you were a car, the sympathetic system would be the gas pedal. It gives you short-term boosts in energy, activates the adrenal gland, and triggers dilation and vasoconstriction. The parasympathetic nervous system controls the opposite responses, sometimes called the ‚Äúfeed-and-breed‚Äù actions. This is the equivalent of a car‚Äôs brake pedal. The parasympathetic nerves act on digestion, salivation, sexual arousal, and tears. Both systems are involved in breathing, and the right techniques can help strengthen both sides of the nervous system.",
"A few months after their expedition Bujize published a letter to the editor in the journal Wilderness & Environmental Medicine stating that out of the 25 people on the journey, only one experienced severe symptoms. This single man, with a heart condition, had to descend early. Everyone else made it to the rim of the volcano. Almost all of them were shirtless the whole time. The 92 percent success rate was unheard of in medical literature. Or, as Bujize wrote in reserved medical-speak in his letter, ‚ÄúThe method seems to have a direct biological effect on the autonomic nervous system, and warrants further investigation . . . The remarkable results are most likely explained by the continuous controlled hyperventilation reducing hypoxia severity. However, the resultant state of respiratory alkalosis may cause symptoms such as dizziness and visual disturbances. The fact that none of the trekkers experienced such",
"Even after such a short training program the active group showed positive levels of epinephrine as well as an increased amount of anti-inflammatory molecules in their blood. They had fewer fever-like symptoms than the control group experienced, and their cortisol levels returned to normal much quicker. To quote the subsequent journal article from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: ‚ÄúHitherto, both the autonomic nervous system and innate immune system were regarded as systems that cannot be voluntarily influenced. The present study demonstrates that, through practicing techniques learned in a short-term training program, the sympathetic nervous systems and immune system can indeed be voluntarily influenced.‚Äù",
"It only takes a matter of weeks for the human body to acclimatize to a dazzling array of conditions. Once you arrive at high altitude, your body automatically produces more red blood cells to compensate for lower oxygen saturation. Move to an oppressively hot environment and your body will sweat out fewer salts over time and produce lower volumes of urine. Heat will also stimulate your cardiovascular system to become more efficient and increase evaporation and cooling. Yet no environmental extreme induces as many changes in human physiology as the cold does.",
"In 2011, Hof met with Dutch immunologists Peter Pickkers and Matthijs Kox at Radboud University after making the outrageous claim that he could consciously subdue or ramp up his immune system at will. It was a claim that was, by definition, impossible.",
"This, I will learn later, is what paramedics who rescue hypothermic patients call ‚Äúafterdrop.‚Äù During vasoconstriction the limbs get much colder than the core. When the body starts to warm up, it lets blood through the vascular system again. Blood chills as it passes through the cold arms, hands, and feet, and when it eventually circulates back to the heart it lowers the body‚Äôs overall core temperature. In extreme cases, afterdrop can be fatal. An hour elapses before I feel ready to get back on my feet for the climb down the mountain. No longer focused enough to let my body resist the elements, I don the black pea-coat that I brought up in a backpack.",
"The combination of breathing exercises, muscle flexing, and visualization are the basic core exercises of Hof‚Äôs training. But meditation and breathing practice alone only comprise half the equation. While these activities can prime the nervous system for ceding some control to the conscious mind, in order to make real progress you need to use the environment to trigger an autonomic response that you usually have no ability to access on your own.",
"In broad strokes, however, thermogenic research has showed four main strategies that the body can use to resist the cold: Humans can increase their metabolic rate by shivering; they can stay warm through some passive metabolic mechanism; or they can shunt blood to their core by closing off the arteries in their extremities. Lastly, as in most cases of people who live in colder climates, the human body can also accumulate higher levels of ordinary white fat as an insulation to help stem heat loss in the first place.",
"The well-trained car salesman puts a slight damper on his customer‚Äôs excitement over the black car by saying, ‚ÄúBlack is a powerful color for a sports car, but it sure shows the dirt. It‚Äôll take work.‚Äù This brings the positive adversary closer to neutral and at the same time urges him to validate his own enthusiasm for the color black‚Äîhis vision of the color black.",
"I‚Äôve already pointed out some of the dangers of neediness. Another danger of neediness of any kind is that it interferes with blank slating. So does the fear of hearing ‚Äúno‚Äù and the fear of failing.

"My principle (and title), ‚ÄúStart with No,‚Äù is based on the understanding that ‚Äúno‚Äù is a decision. An early ‚Äúyes‚Äù is probably a trick, and ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù is just that, maybe, and gets you nowhere. But ‚Äúno‚Äù is a decision that gives everyone something to talk about, that helps you maintain control,",
Build their energy budget. Increase the preparation required by the adversary to complete the deal (‚ÄúThis just doesn‚Äôt make sense to us. Can you redo it?‚Äù). Tactically withhold decision makers from the negotiation (‚ÄúWe‚Äôve talked this over and decided that your team needs to go to New York to show this to Mr. Smith‚Äù). Always be guided by your mission and purpose.,
"Budget in the Camp System breaks down into three budgets that help us account for and control this real price in time-and-energy, money, and emotional investment. (I unite time and energy because it‚Äôs hard to spend one without spending the other as well.) The overall budget is a comprehensive, powerful tool, another means by which we can retain control in the negotiation by making certain that our investments are working for us, not against us.",
"Just as with time-and-energy, you want money to work for you and against your adversary. You will try to drive up your adversary‚Äôs budget by making the negotiation literally expensive, and your adversary will try to do the same, because everyone knows that a money squeeze is often followed by compromise if the untrained negotiator loses sight of his mission and purpose.",
"As I‚Äôve said in several contexts, we have a tendency to want to save our adversary, to be liked. This instinct can impel us into these three common negotiating errors, which I have derived from what every attorney tells his client before a deposition or testimony: never answer an unasked question; don‚Äôt interpret a statement as a question; and never reply to random statements. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like what I see, Jim.‚Äù When we hear this, many of us will feel an urge to reply in some way, to try to set things right. ‚ÄúWell, Damon, this isn‚Äôt written in concrete.‚Äù No! The best way to deal with the leading unasked question or the provocative remark is to use it as a basis for prying out more information. How? By employing what I call a connector.

"No talking! This is one of my cardinal rules‚Äîand an exaggeration, as I admitted earlier. I don‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt utter a word, but I do mean that in a negotiation most of us should talk a lot less than we do, in the interest of controlling neediness, in the interest of blank slating. When we are spare with our words, we are able to ask much more focused questions, which keep us on track and give us clearer pictures. If you can‚Äôt keep from talking, you won‚Äôt be able to blank slate.",

"Believing that the positive strip is dangerous reveals that you‚Äôre stuck in a ‚Äúrush to close‚Äù mode. Remember, everything hinges on your adversary‚Äôs vision. You want to do everything you can to build that vision. The positive strip line does just that, as you will learn the minute you put this fuel into practice. ‚ÄúBefore you sign this deal, are you sure this is something you really want to do?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôve thought about it a great deal and it makes perfect sense.‚Äù Or: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great, Joan.

The moment you understand the honesty and the power of ‚Äúno‚Äù you will have taken a long stride away from emotion-based negotiating and toward decision-based negotiating.",
"In a negotiation, decisions are 100 percent emotional. Yes, 100 percent. Research psychologists have proved this beyond any doubt. Sometimes we use the term ‚Äúnegotiation science,‚Äù but the ‚Äúscience‚Äù part is knowing that decisions themselves are all emotion. In a Camp negotiation, it is always gut-check time, because this is where the real negotiation is being played out.",

How do you find out the truth? The same way you find out the truth on any issue in a negotiation: You ask those interrogative-led questions. ‚ÄúOf course you make the decisions.

You could think of my system‚Äîand this book‚Äîas nothing more or less than a means to identify activities and behaviors that we can control during a negotiation.,
"Questions do serve the further purpose of helping us control our own neediness and to be unokay‚Äîand this is a valuable purpose, I hope we all agree‚Äîbut the vital purpose of questions is to allow us to move around in the adversary‚Äôs world and see what they see and then lead them to a clear vision and decision as well.",
"The reverse is the behavioral tactic that answers a question with a question, the answer to which will do you some good. When your adversary asks you a question, you do have to say something, but not in the way in which you were trained in school.",
"The excitement of winning and the pain of losing, of failing, are the two key emotions for both you and your adversary, and sophisticated corporate negotiating teams are trained to drive up your emotional budget‚Äîas well as the other two budgets, of course‚Äîwith promises, threats, ridiculous requests and deadlines, sudden exclamations that the deal has gone south, and the like.",

"You or your company may well have many M&Ps, because you have one for almost every major task you undertake, and for many seemingly minor tasks as well. You have the overall mission and purpose for your business or enterprise. You have a second mission and purpose for your negotiation with a specific adversary. Within that negotiation you have yet other layers of mission and purpose, each of which guides the decision making at that point. In complicated, high-stakes negotiations, my clients may have a written mission and purpose for almost every phone call to anyone on the other side. No kidding.

"The tougher the negotiation, the more critical it is to understand that if someone in this room has to be unokay, it will be you and not your adversary.

"Now let‚Äôs recall that negotiation from earlier in this chapter, the one in which the adversary wants the same volume discount for three thousand widgets that our company usually gives for much larger orders. Mentioning the number thirty-three thousand early in the negotiation was intended to drive up my client‚Äôs positive expectations, and against many negotiators this time-tested trick might have worked. But my team had done its research. It knew that the multinational‚Äôs total worldwide capacity for these widgets was only twenty-two thousand units. The nerve! Those negotiators never intended to procure thirty-three thousand widgets. They were only interested in driving up expectations and thereby extracting a price they could then use for leverage.",

"But the presentation, by definition, puts the adversary into the intellectual mode. When the adversary is in the intellectual mode, he raises objections, doesn‚Äôt he?

Simply put, the cause of the various diseases we experience is the cure. The mind that grasps is the mind that sets us free.",
"‚ÄúThat shift in perspective has made all the difference. When I feel anxious or afraid, I can look at that those impulses and see that I have a choice.

If we treat some condition, feeling, sensation, or any other type of experience as an enemy, we only make it stronger: We‚Äôre resisting and succumbing to it at the same time.

The world around us, our bodies, our thoughts and feelings‚Äîeven our thoughts about our thoughts and feelings‚Äîare in constant flux, a progressive and ceaseless interplay of causes and conditions that create certain effects, which themselves become the causes and conditions that give rise to still other effects. In Buddhist terms, this constant change is known as impermanence. In many of his teachings the Buddha compared this movement to the tiny changes that occur in the flow of a river.",
"The Suffering of Change, then, could be understood as a type of addiction, a never-ending search for a lasting ‚Äúhigh‚Äù that is just out of reach. In fact, according to neuroscientists I‚Äôve spoken with, the high we feel simply from the anticipation of getting what we want is linked to the production of dopamine, a chemical in the brain that generates, among other things, sensations of pleasure. Over time, our brains and our bodies are motivated to repeat the activities that stimulate the production of dopamine. We literally get hooked on anticipation.",
"Caught up in the habit of looking through a window and defining experience in terms of what we see through it, we don‚Äôt recognize that the window itself is what enables us to see.

In so doing, we begin very gradually to recognize that the window and what we see through it occur simultaneously. If we look out a window in one direction, for example, we‚Äôll see traffic, clouds, rain, and so on, in a particular way. If we look in a different direction, we‚Äôll see things a little differently: the clouds may seem closer or darker while cars and people may seem bigger or smaller. If we take a step back, though, and look at the entire window, we can begin to recognize these limited, or directional, perspectives as different aspects of a much vaster panorama. There is an unlimited realm of passing thoughts, emotions, and sensations visible through our window, yet not affecting the w",

As you exhale, imagine all the happiness and benefits you‚Äôve acquired during your life pouring out of yourself in the form of clear light. This light extends out toward all beings and dissolves into them, fulfilling all their needs and eliminating their suffering.

From a simply practical point of view, the ability to ‚Äúmap‚Äù and navigate our daily lives in dualistic terms is essential. In talking to people over the years, however, I‚Äôve encountered a common misconception that Buddhism considers dualistic perception as a kind of defect. That is not the case.

"Birth, however, is considered an aspect of suffering for a couple of reasons. First of all, the transition from the protected environment of the womb (or an egg) into the wider world of sensory experience is considered‚Äînot only by Buddhist philosophers, but by many experts in the psychological, scientific, and health care fields‚Äîas something of a traumatic shift in experience.

"On a purely literal level, the first Buddha Nature Blocker is known as ‚Äúfaintheartedness‚Äù or ‚Äútimidity.‚Äù On a deeper level, the term points to a deeply ingrained tendency to judge or to criticize ourselves, exaggerating what we may perceive as defects in thought, feeling, character, or behavior.

"Second Noble Truth, often translated as the ‚Äúorigin‚Äù or ‚Äúcause‚Äù of suffering. Our normal tendency is to assign the cause of suffering to circumstances or conditions. According to the Second Noble Truth, however, the cause of suffering lies not in events or circumstances, but in the way we perceive and interpret our experience as it unfolds.",
"This plan is laid out in the Fourth Noble Truth, often referred to as the ‚ÄúTruth of the Path.‚Äù",
"At any given moment, you can choose to follow the chain of thoughts, emotions, and sensations that reinforce a perception of yourself as vulnerable and limited‚Äîor you can remember that your true nature is pure, unconditioned, and incapable of being harmed.",

"It‚Äôs important, first of all, to note that Buddhist teachings don‚Äôt argue that in order to find true freedom people have to give up their homes, their jobs, their cars, or any other material possessions. As his own life story shows, the Buddha himself had tried a life of extreme austerity without finding the peace he sought.",
"In other words, we‚Äôre not really seeing the rose itself, but rather a concept of it. This concept is often conditioned by a broad range of factors, including the circumstances surrounding our initial experience, the memories and expectations stored in various parts of the brain, modifications that may occur through later experience‚Äîand, perhaps most importantly, the distinction between the experiencer (me) and what is experienced (the rose).",
"In India, where I have spent a great deal of my life, a large belly, a round face, and a double or even triple chin are considered by many as signs of health and success and wealth. Yet among many of the people I‚Äôve met in Western cultures these same physical characteristics are often considered signs of ill health.",
"While the effects of gross continuous impermanence are readily apparent, they actually arise from another type of continuous change, which the Buddha described as subtle impermanence, a shifting of conditions that occurs ‚Äúbehind the scenes‚Äù as it were, on such a deep level that it barely, if ever, approaches our awareness.",
"The first ‚Äúpoint‚Äù involves establishing a firm base or anchor that connects you to the environment in which you‚Äôre practicing while providing a reference to the rest of your body. If possible, cross your legs so that each foot rests on the opposite leg.",
"First, depending on your circumstances, assume whatever physical posture is most convenient or comfortable. Next, allow your mind to rest for a moment in objectless attention. Just observe all the thoughts, sensations, and so on, that come up. Then choose something to look at‚Äîthe color of someone‚Äôs hair, the shape of his or her haircut, or a rose, a peach, or your desktop‚Äîand just rest your attention on it, noticing its shape or color. You don‚Äôt have to stare and if you need to blink, just blink. (In fact, if you don‚Äôt blink, your eyes will probably become irritated and whatever you‚Äôre looking at may appear irritating.) After a few moments of looking at someone or something, let your mind simply relax again in objectless attention. Return your focus to the object for a few moments; then allow your mind to relax once more.",
"In other words, to use the mind to look at the mind. That‚Äôs a basic definition of what, in the Buddhist tradition, is commonly referred to as ‚Äúmeditation.‚Äù",
"Emptiness, the main subject of the Second Turning of the Wheel of Dharma, is probably one of the most confusing terms in Buddhist philosophy. Even long-term students of Buddhism have a hard time understanding it. Maybe that‚Äôs why the Buddha waited sixteen years after turning the First Wheel of Dharma to start talking about",
"The ideal approach lies between these two extremes. Hmm, there‚Äôs a thought. There‚Äôs a feeling. There‚Äôs a sensation. Oh, now it‚Äôs gone. Oh, now it‚Äôs back. Oh, now it‚Äôs gone again. Now it‚Äôs back. We can treat these appearances and disappearances like a game, the way children sometimes look at clouds: ‚ÄúWhat do you see?‚Äù a child may exclaim. ‚ÄúI see a dragon!‚Äù one might respond.",
"The technical term for using the sense of sight as a means of resting the mind is ‚Äúform meditation.‚Äù Sounds a bit scary, doesn‚Äôt it? Very strict and precise. Actually, form meditation is quite simple. In fact, we practice it unconsciously throughout the day, whenever we look at something like a television screen, a big pile of dirty dishes in the sink, or a person ahead of us at the grocery store. Form meditation simply involves raising this unconscious process to the level of active awareness.",
"Relative wisdom, acknowledging limited and limiting beliefs and behaviors, is only part of the path of cessation: what you might call the ‚Äúpreparation stage.‚Äù In order to actually cut through our self-imposed limitations, we need to spend a little time observing our mental and emotional habits, befriending them, and perhaps discovering within our most challenging experiences a powerful company of bodyguards.",
"Step One: Objectless Attention The most basic approach to attention is referred to as ‚Äúobject-less‚Äù‚Äînot focusing on any specific ‚Äúscene‚Äù or aspect of experience, but just looking and marveling at the wide range of scenery as it comes and goes.",
"In a way, the Four Noble Truths can be seen as a pragmatic, step-by-step approach to healing what we might nowadays call a ‚Äúdysfunctional‚Äù perspective that binds us to a reality shaped by expectations and preconceptions and blinds us to the inherently unlimited power of the mind.",
"Count the first inhalation and exhalation as ‚Äúone,‚Äù the next inhalation and exhalation as ‚Äútwo,‚Äù and so on, until you reach twenty-one.",
"The best way to work with thoughts is to step back and rest your mind in objectless shinay for a minute and then bring your attention to each thought and the ideas that revolve around it. Observe both directly for a few minutes, just as you would observe the shape or color of a form. Then rest in the simple awareness of bare attention, alternating between attention to thoughts and the broader field of objectless attention.",
"Simply leave your eyes open as they normally are throughout the day. At the same time, it‚Äôs best to maintain some sort of focus so that the eyes aren‚Äôt wandering all the time, shifting around from experience to experience:",
The dash is used in two ways. One is to amplify or justify in the second part of the sentence a thought you stated in the first part.,
"Writing is related to character. If your values are sound, your writing will be sound. It all begins with intention. Figure out what you want to do and how you want to do it, and work your way with humanity and integrity to the completed article. Then you‚Äôll have something to sell.",
"You learn to write by writing. It‚Äôs a truism, but what makes it a truism is that it‚Äôs true. The only way to learn to write is to force yourself to produce a certain number of words on a regular basis.",
"As I recently learned, however, ego is something of a mistranslation of what Sigmund Freud originally referred to as the conscious aspect of the mind. It is a set of functions that include decision making, planning, and analyzing information, which work together to achieve a balance among instinctive tendencies of desire and aversion, the memories, ideas, and habits impressed on us as children, and the conditions and events that occur in our environment. In his original writings, Freud referred to this collection of functions as the ‚ÄúI,‚Äù a coherent sense of self that emerges from this delicate balancing act. The word ‚Äúego‚Äù was later substituted in translation in order to make his insights more acceptable to the scientific community of the mid-twentieth century.",
"The Truth of Cessation is often described as a final release from fixation, craving, or ‚Äúthirst.‚Äù However, while the term ‚Äúcessation‚Äù seems to imply something different or better than our present experience, it is actually a matter of acknowledging the potential already inherent within us.",
"Buddhist science describes a sixth sense, known as mental consciousness.",
"This explanation of the Suffering of Change is close, but it misses the point. The dissatisfaction or disenchantment experienced when the novelty wears off or the situation starts to fall apart is actually the Suffering of Suffering. The Suffering of Change stems, more accurately, from the attachment to the pleasure derived from getting what we want: be it a relationship, a job, a good grade on an exam, or a shiny new car.",
"The qualities of buddha nature such as wisdom, capability, loving-kindness, and compassion have been described by the Buddha and the masters who followed him as ‚Äúboundless,‚Äù ‚Äúlimitless,‚Äù and ‚Äúinfinite.‚Äù",
"The third point is to allow some space between the arms and the upper body, lifting and spreading the shoulders a little bit.",
"My father‚Äôs advice to me, when I told him of the trouble I was having practicing meditation, offered a middle way between these two extremes. Instead of trying to block distractions or give in to them, I could welcome them as friends: ‚ÄúHello, fear! Hello, itch! How are you? Why don‚Äôt you stick around awhile so we can get to know each other?‚Äù",
"Then gently bring your attention to this thought: ‚ÄúJust as I want to achieve happiness and avoid suffering, other beings also feel the same way.‚Äù You don‚Äôt need to visualize specific beings, although you may start out with a specific visualization if you find it helpful. Eventually, though, tonglen extends beyond anyone or anything you can imagine to include animals, insects, and all the creatures who have suffered or will suffer in any way.",
"Thrust into a realm in which everything changes‚Äîsecond by second, cell by cell, and atom by atom‚Äîwe long for certainty, stability, and satisfaction. The three basic poisons of ignorance, attachment, and aversion could be described as a very basic set of responses to this longing.",
Another choice is unity of mood.,
This student is railing against two things that most people eventually discover in their education. One is the hierarchy of disciplines in schools that we discussed in the first chapter. The other is that conformity has a higher value than diversity.,
"But there‚Äôs a third level of experience which I call ‚Äúfake relative reality.‚Äù In it, ideas, feelings, and perceptions are intimately bound up in our perception of ourselves, other people, sensations, and situations. Fake relative reality is the main source of self-created suffering. It emerges from attachment to ideas, feelings, and perceptions about ourselves and others as essential characteristics.",

"As a young student at Sherab Ling, I was taught to look out for three such ‚Äúbumps‚Äù in particular: permanence, singularity, and independence.",
"The Buddha‚Äôs plan went far beyond learning to become ‚Äúokay.‚Äù His aim was for us to become buddhas: to awaken our capacity to approach every experience‚Äîgrief, shame, jealousy, frustration, illness, and even death‚Äîwith the innocent perspective we experience when looking for the first time, for example, at the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone National Park, or the views from the top of Taipei 101.",
"The fifth and final Buddha Nature Blocker, which might be considered the foundation of the others, is traditionally interpreted as self-obsession. In contemporary terms, we can understand it as the ‚Äúmyth of me‚Äù",
"We don‚Äôt have much choice in terms of our susceptibility to the experiences over which we have no control. But there is another category of pain, discomfort, dukkha, or whatever you want to call it: a virtually infinite variety of psychological tributaries that our minds spin around the people, events, and situations we encounter. My father and other teachers helped me to think of this type of pain as ‚Äúself-created‚Äù: experiences that evolve from our interpretation of situations and events, such as impulsive anger or lingering resentment aroused by others who behave in ways we don‚Äôt like, jealousy toward people who have more than we do, and paralyzing anxiety that occurs when there‚Äôs no reason to be afraid. Self-created suffering can take the form of the stories we tell ourselves, often deeply embedded in our unconsciousness, about not being good enough, rich enough, attractive enough, or secure in other ways.",
The actual instruction is to lengthen the neck by tilting your chin slightly more toward your throat than you may ordinarily be used to doing while allowing yourself some freedom of movement. The sensation could be described as simply resting your head on your neck.,
"As we‚Äôve seen earlier, there‚Äôs no way we can experience complete happiness and an end to suffering for ourselves without direct experience of our own and others‚Äô desire for happiness and release from suffering. Working toward our own release is like pulling the needle only out of one cheek. As long as a needle remains in our other cheek, we‚Äôll always feel a bit of discomfort, pain, or fear.",
"Begin by ‚Äútaming your horse.‚Äù If you‚Äôre practicing formally, assume the seven-point posture to the best of your ability. Otherwise, just straighten your spine while keeping the rest of your body relaxed and balanced. ‚ÄúTame the rider‚Äù by allowing your mind simply to relax in a state of objectless attention. After a few moments, perform a quick ‚Äúscanning exercise.‚Äù This time, however, instead of focusing on the sensations themselves, gently allow yourself to recognize that you have a body, as well as a mind that‚Äôs capable of scanning it. Allow yourself to recognize how wonderful these very basic facts of your existence really are and how precious it is to have a body and a mind capable of being aware of the body. Appreciating these gifts plants the seeds for happiness and relief from suffering. There is such relief in simply knowing you‚Äôre alive and aware.",
"I define culture as the values and forms of behavior that characterize different social groups. Culture is a system of permissions. It‚Äôs about the attitudes and behaviors that are acceptable and unacceptable in different communities, those that are approved of and those that are not.

The real measure of a great engineer is how quickly that engineer can simplify a complex problem (see Rule 3) and develop an easily understood and maintainable solution.,
The large point is one of authority. Every little qualifier whittles away some fraction of the reader‚Äôs trust. Readers want a writer who believes in himself and in what he is saying. Don‚Äôt diminish that belief. Don‚Äôt be kind of bold.,

The first step in using log files is to aggregate them.,
How to use: ‚Ä¢ Design for 20x capacity. ‚Ä¢ Implement for 3x capacity. ‚Ä¢ Deploy for ~1.5x capacity.,
Strive for active/active configurations. Why: Maximize availability through multiple instances. Key takeaways: Strive for active/active rather than active/passive solutions. Use load balancers to balance traffic across instances of a service. Use control services with active/passive instances for patterns that require singletons.,
"QA doesn‚Äôt increase the quality of your system, as you can‚Äôt test quality into a system. If used properly, it can increase your productivity while decreasing cost and most importantly it can keep you from increasing defect rates faster than your rate of organization growth during periods of rapid hiring.",
Therefore ask yourself some basic questions before you start. For example: ‚ÄúIn what capacity am I going to address the reader?‚Äù (Reporter? Provider of information? Average man or woman?) ‚ÄúWhat pronoun and tense am I going to use?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat style?‚Äù (Impersonal reportorial? Personal but formal? Personal and casual?) ‚ÄúWhat attitude am I going to take toward the material?‚Äù (Involved? Judgmental? ‚ÄúHow much do I want to cover?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat one point do I want to make?‚Äù,
Writers must therefore constantly ask: what am I trying to say? Surprisingly often they don‚Äôt know.,
Systems that are overly complex limit your ability to scale. Simple systems are more easily and cost effectively maintained and scaled.,
The implementation of state limits scalability and increases cost. Key takeaways: Always push back on the need for state in any system. Use business metrics and multivariate (or A/B) testing to determine whether state in an application truly results in the expected user behavior and business value.,

"One of the enemies of creativity and innovation, especially in relation to our own development, is common sense. The play-wright Bertolt Brecht said that as soon as something seems the most obvious thing in the world, it means that we have abandoned all attempts at understanding it.",
"Rule 39‚ÄîEnsure You Can Wire On and Off Functions Rule 39: What, When, How, and Why What: Create a framework to disable and enable features of your product.",
"The list type in Scala is covariant. This means that for each pair of types S and T, if S is a subtype of T, then List[S] is a subtype of List[T]. For instance, List[String] is a subtype of List[Object]. This is natural because every list of strings can also be seen as a list of objects.",
"If you aren‚Äôt allowed to use ‚ÄúI,‚Äù at least think ‚ÄúI‚Äù while you write, or write the first draft in the first person and then take the ‚ÄúI‚Äùs out. It will warm up your impersonal style.",
"In our business, availability and scalability go hand in hand. A product that isn‚Äôt highly available really doesn‚Äôt need to scale and a site that can‚Äôt scale won‚Äôt be highly available when the demand comes. As such, you really can‚Äôt work on one without thinking about the other.",
But the secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components.,
"Never say anything in writing that you wouldn‚Äôt comfortably say in conversation. If you‚Äôre not a person who says ‚Äúindeed‚Äù or ‚Äúmoreover,‚Äù or who calls someone an individual (‚Äúhe‚Äôs a fine individual‚Äù), please don‚Äôt write it.",
"The Russian novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn saw this clearly. ‚ÄúIf you want to change the world,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwho do you begin with, yourself or others? I believe if we begin with ourselves and do the things that we need to do and become the best person we can be, we have a much better chance of changing the world for the better.‚Äù",
"If a function literal consists of one statement that takes a single argument, you need not explicitly name and specify the argument.",
The Element is the meeting point between natural aptitude and personal passion.,
"When a singleton object shares the same name with a class, it is called that class's companion object. You must define both the class and its companion object in the same source file. The class is called the companion class of the singleton object. A class and its companion object can access each other's private members.",
"Finding the right tribe can be essential to finding your Element. On the other hand, feeling deep down that you‚Äôre with the wrong one is probably a good sign that you should look somewhere else.",
"Surprise is the most refreshing element in nonfiction writing. If something surprises you it will also surprise‚Äîand delight‚Äîthe people you are writing for, especially as you conclude your story and send them on their way.",
We often guide our clients to leverage the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù for burst capacity so that we don‚Äôt have 33% of our assets waiting around for a sudden increase in user activity.,
"Therefore think small. Decide what corner of your subject you‚Äôre going to bite off, and be content to cover it well and stop.",
"Y axis or data/service-oriented splits, allow for efficient scaling of transactions, large data sets, and can help with fault isolation.",
Your style will be warmer and truer to your personality if you use contractions like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll‚Äù and ‚Äúwon‚Äôt‚Äù and ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù when they fit comfortably into what you‚Äôre writing.,
The point is that you have to strip your writing down before you can build it back up.,
Use a separate tier in your architecture for object caches.,
"Finding a deeper voice (and more full, resonant laugh) is a side effect of functional breathing and coming into greater regulation https://t.co/nVu53nXWam",https://twitter.com/jonnym1ller/status/1627108854889852928?s=12&t=1aczFlNnvLfm0_fIjCRjSQ
"External API/third party‚Äî Is the call to a third party or external API? If so these absolutely should be made into asynchronous calls. Way too many things can go wrong with external calls to make these synchronous. If any way possible, you do not want the health and availability of your system tied to a system that you can‚Äôt control.",
"Database changes must only be additive‚Äî Columns or tables should only be added, not deleted, until the next version of code is released that deprecates the dependency on those columns.",
"Rule 49‚ÄîDesign Your Application to Be Monitored Rule 49: What, When, How, and Why What: Think about how you will need to monitor your application as you are designing it. When to use: Anytime you add or change modules of your code base. How to use: Build hooks into your system to record transaction times.",
Key takeaways: Use asynchronous communication techniques to ensure that each service and tier is as independent as possible. This allows the system to scale much farther than if all components are closely coupled together.,
"Gardner has argued to wide acclaim that we have not one but multiple intelligences. They include linguistic, musical, mathematical, spatial, kinesthetic, interpersonal (relationships with others), and intra-personal (knowledge and understanding of the self) intelligence. He argues that these types of intelligence are more or less independent of each other, and none is more important, though some might be ‚Äúdominant‚Äù while others are ‚Äúdormant.‚Äù",
Nobody told all the new computer writers that the essence of writing is rewriting. Just because they‚Äôre writing fluently doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre writing well.,
"One of Ballantine‚Äôs lessons to Lou was to ‚Äúzig when everyone else is zagging,‚Äù his way of suggesting that the fastest path to success is often to go against the flow.",
"What he learned about film and writing came largely from observation, an intense level of intellectual curiosity, and an off-the-charts ability to feel for and see into the lives of other people.",
"When demand is temporary, spiky, and inconsistent and when response time is not a core issue in the product.",
"Discovering the Element is all about allowing yourself access to all of the ways in which you experience the world, and discovering where your own true strengths lie. Just don‚Äôt take them for granted.",
"Key takeaways: Teams can save a lot of money and time by thinking of how to scale solutions early, implementing (coding) them a month or so before they are needed, and implementing them days before the customer rush or demand.",
"Many people set aside their passions to pursue things they don‚Äôt care about for the sake of financial security. The fact is, though, that the job you took because it ‚Äúpays the bills‚Äù could easily move offshore in the coming decade.",
You can think of creativity as applied imagination.,
You are writing for yourself. Don‚Äôt try to visualize the great mass audience. There is no such audience‚Äîevery reader is a different person.,
"In fact, fandom is in many ways a form of what psychologists rather awkwardly call ‚Äúdeindividuation.‚Äù This means losing your sense of identity through becoming part of a group. Extreme forms of deindividuation lead to mob behavior.",
"here are many metered parking street spots in and around the downtown
area. The problem is worse during the peak demand hours of weekday mornings and weekend
evenings. The free parking spots are not always easy to locate. This leads to a number of
motorists roaming around looking for parking which makes the problem worse by creating
additional traffic congestion.

"As soon as we have the power to release our minds from the immediate here and now, in a sense we are free. We are free to revisit the past, free to reframe the present, and free to anticipate a whole range of possible futures. Imagination is the foundation of everything that is uniquely and distinctively human.",
Our grocery store example is essentially the same activity as the select (*) case above.,
"Michelangelo once said, ‚ÄúThe greatest danger for most of us is not that our aim is too high and we miss it, but that it is too low and we reach it.‚Äù For all our futures, we need to aim high and be determined to succeed.",
"For me, the best in breed is Susan Jeffers‚Äôs landmark book Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway¬Æ.",
"There are three major processes in education: the curriculum, which is what the school system expects students to learn; pedagogy, the process by which the system helps students to do it; and assessment, the process of judging how well they are doing.",
"Earlier, I argued that we don‚Äôt see the world directly. We perceive it through frameworks of ideas and beliefs, which act as filters on what we see and how we see it. Some of these ideas enter our consciousness so deeply that we‚Äôre not even aware of them. They strike us as simple common sense. They often show up, though, in the metaphors and images we use to think about ourselves and about the world around us.",
"Ultimately the product that any writer has to sell is not the subject being written about, but who he or she is.",
"The second role of a mentor is encouragement. Mentors lead us to believe that we can achieve something that seemed improbable or impossible to us before we met them. They don‚Äôt allow us to succumb to self-doubt for too long, or the notion that our dreams are too large for us. They stand by to remind us of the skills we already possess and what we can achieve if we continue to work hard.",
"Sell yourself, and your subject will exert its own appeal. Believe in your own identity and your own opinions. Writing is an act of ego, and you might as well admit it. Use its energy to keep yourself going.",
"Scala classes and functions can be deÔ¨Åned inside many contexts: classes, functions, blocks, etc. Additionally, classes can be deÔ¨Åned directly inside of a package, and are then said to be at the top level. Top-level classes which do not appear in the scope of an explicit package declaration are implicitly placed inside of a special, anonymous package.",
"Creative teams are dynamic. Diversity of talents is important, but it is not enough. Different ways of thinking can be an obstacle to creativity. Creative teams find ways of using their differences as strengths, not weaknesses. They have a process through which their strengths are complementary and compensate for each other‚Äôs weaknesses too. They are able to challenge each other as equals, and to take criticism as an incentive to raise their game.",
"Humor is best achieved by understatement, and there‚Äôs nothing subtle about an exclamation point.",
"The second principle of swimlanes is that no synchronous calls happen between swimlanes. Because synchronous calls tie services together, the failure of a service being called can propagate to all other systems calling it in a synchronous and blocking fashion. Therefore, it would violate the notion of fault isolation if a failure of a service we hoped to be in one swimlane could cause the failure of a service in another swimlane.",
"High achievers often share similar attitudes, such as perseverance, self-belief, optimism, ambition, and frustration. How we perceive our circumstances and how we create and take opportunities depends largely on what we expect of ourselves.",
I use the term the Element to describe the place where the things we love to do and the things we are good at come together.,
"Finding your tribe can have transformative effects on your sense of identity and purpose. This is because of three powerful tribal dynamics: validation, inspiration, and what we‚Äôll call here the ‚Äúalchemy of synergy.‚Äù",
They have discovered their Element‚Äîthe place where the things you love to do and the things that you are good at come together.,
"History is full of examples of people who didn‚Äôt discover their real creative abilities until they discovered the media in which they thought best. In my experience, one of the main reasons that so many other people think they‚Äôre not creative is that they simply haven‚Äôt found their medium.",
The race in writing is not to the swift but to the original.,
One of the strongest signs of being in the zone is a sense of freedom and of authenticity.,
"What is true is that if you‚Äôre not prepared to be wrong, you‚Äôll never come up with anything original.",

"when everything we do is measured against its contribution to achieving one objective or another, it robs us of the chance for playful discovery. So objectives do come with a cost.

"Objectives are well and good when they are sufficiently modest, but things get a lot more complicated when they‚Äôre more ambitious. In fact, objectives actually become obstacles towards more exciting achievements, like those involving discovery, creativity, invention, or innovation‚Äîor even achieving true happiness. In other words (and here is the paradox), the greatest achievements become less likely when they are made objectives.

If a manufacturer decided to increase efficiency by 5‚Äâ%, no one would be shocked if it succeeded. A software company upgrading its product from version 2.0 to version 3.0 is similarly likely to succeed, as happens all the time.

"It‚Äôs useful to think of achievement as a process of discovery. We can think of painting a masterpiece as essentially discovering it within the set of all possible images. It‚Äôs as if we are searching through all the possibilities for the one we want, which we call our objective. Of course, we‚Äôre not talking about search in the same casual sense in which you might search for a missing sock in the laundry machine. This type of search is more elevated, the kind an artist performs when exploring her creative whims. But the point is that the familiar concept of search can actually make sense of more lofty pursuits like art, science, or technology.",
"Can you imagine life with fewer objectives, or with no objectives at all? Would it lead to any good? Regardless of how you‚Äôd answer these questions, at the least they highlight how deeply our culture has come to revere objectives.",

"These stories of delayed revelations and serendipitous discovery expose the danger of objectives: If your objective was to invent a microwave oven, you would not be working on radars. If you wanted to build a flying machine (as countless failed inventors did over the years), you wouldn‚Äôt spend the next few decades instead trying to invent an engine. If you were like Charles Babbage in the 1820s [5] and wanted to build a computer, you wouldn‚Äôt dedicate the rest of your life to refining vacuum tube technology. But in all these cases, what you would never do is exactly what you should have done. The paradox is that the key stepping stones were perfected only by people without the ultimate objective of building microwaves, airplanes, or computers.",
"Sometimes the best way to achieve something great is to stop trying to achieve a particular great thing. In other words, greatness is possible if you are willing to stop demanding what that greatness should be. While it seems like discussing objectives leads to one paradox after another, this idea really should make sense. Aren‚Äôt the greatest moments and epiphanies in life so often unexpected and unplanned? Serendipity can play an outsize role in life. There‚Äôs a reason for this pattern. Even though serendipity is often portrayed as a happy accident, maybe it‚Äôs not always so accidental after all. In fact, as we‚Äôll show, there‚Äôs a lot we can do to attract serendipity, aside from simply betting on random luck.",
"The weight of objectives on our thinking even impacts the way we talk about topics like animals in nature. After all, whenever evolution is discussed, we view animals through the lens of survival and reproduction, evolution‚Äôs assumed objective. Even many algorithms, or programs that run inside computers, are designed to work towards some specific objective, such as finding the best search result or playing a better game of chess. In fact, these kinds of algorithms are quite common in artificial intelligence and machine learning. So it may come as no surprise that the term objective function is now practically a household name in such fields.",

"Over the years, I have assigned Homework for Life to thousands of people, but only a small percentage has begun doing it. A tragically small percentage.

"these moments are everywhere. They exist in multitudes for all of us. They‚Äôre like dander in the wind. They exist all around us. More than you could ever imagine. The problem is that we don‚Äôt see these moments. We fail to notice them or recognize their importance, and when we happen to see one, we don‚Äôt reach out to catch it. We don‚Äôt record it. We don‚Äôt save it. We fail to keep these precious moments safe for the future.",
"Second, starting your story with a thesis statement reduces your chances of surprising your audience. When you tell me that the story is hilarious, I‚Äôm already primed for humor. When you say, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to believe this,‚Äù I am prepared for the improbable. Surprise is a beautiful thing in a story. Apart from vulnerability, it may be the most beautiful thing about stories. Letting your audience know that your story is hilarious or improbable hinders your ability to catch them off-guard and offer them a surprise later on.",
"1. Try to start your story with forward movement whenever possible. Establish yourself as a person who is physically moving through space. Opening with forward movement creates instant momentum in a story. It makes the audience feel that we‚Äôre already on our way, immersed in the world you are moving us through. We‚Äôre going somewhere important.",
"Hourglasses There comes a time in many stories when you reached a moment (or the moment) that the audience has been waiting for. Perhaps you have paved the way to the moment with Breadcrumbs and Backpacks, or maybe you‚Äôve used none of these strategies because you‚Äôve got yourself a stake-laden story, and now you‚Äôre approaching the payoff. The sentence you‚Äôve been waiting to say. The sentence your audience has been waiting to hear. This is the moment to use an Hourglass. It‚Äôs time to slow things down.

"So dig. Search. Hunt. Fight for the five-second moment. Allow yourself to recall the entire event. Don‚Äôt get hung up on the big moments, the unbelievable circumstances, or the hilarious details. Seek out the moments when you felt your heart move. When something changed forever, even if that moment seems minuscule compared to the rest of the story. That will be your five-second moment.

"When telling a story to an audience, we play a game with them: we pretend that we are speaking completely off the cuff. Extemporaneous storytelling, unprepared and unrehearsed. This is not usually true. While most storytellers don‚Äôt memorize their stories (and I strongly advise against it), they are prepared to tell them. They have memorized specific beats in a story. They know their beginning and ending lines. They have memorized certain laugh lines. They have a plan in place before they begin speaking.",

"What would have been just annoying and forgettable five years ago is now something that I‚Äôve captured and will have for the rest of my life.

"It‚Äôs no surprise then that computer scientists even have a term, search space, that refers to this very concept‚Äîit‚Äôs the general idea that creation and discovery happen within a space of possibilities that contains stepping stones leading from one discovery to another.",
"If we‚Äôre searching for our objective, then we must be searching through something. We can call that something the search space‚Äîthe set of all possible things.",
"The weight of objectives on our thinking even impacts the way we talk about topics like animals in nature. After all, whenever evolution is discussed, we view animals through the lens of survival and reproduction, evolution‚Äôs assumed objective. Even many algorithms, or programs that run inside computers, are designed to work towards some specific objective, such as finding the best search result or playing a better game of chess. In fact, these kinds of algorithms are quite common in artificial intelligence and machine learning. So it may come as no surprise that the term objective function is now practically a household name in such fields.",
"As long as the gradient is going up, chances are that success is coming closer. In a sense we never stop playing the hot and cold game. The process of setting an objective, attempting to achieve it, and measuring progress along the way has become the primary route to achievement in our culture.",
"when everything we do is measured against its contribution to achieving one objective or another, it robs us of the chance for playful discovery. So objectives do come with a cost. Considering that this cost is rarely discussed in any detail, maybe it‚Äôs a good idea to look a little harder at what we‚Äôre really giving up in exchange for such objective optimism.",
"It‚Äôs useful to think of achievement as a process of discovery. We can think of painting a masterpiece as essentially discovering it within the set of all possible images. It‚Äôs as if we are searching through all the possibilities for the one we want, which we call our objective. Of course, we‚Äôre not talking about search in the same casual sense in which you might search for a missing sock in the laundry machine. This type of search is more elevated, the kind an artist performs when exploring her creative whims. But the point is that the familiar concept of search can actually make sense of more lofty pursuits like art, science, or technology.",
"Can you imagine life with fewer objectives, or with no objectives at all? Would it lead to any good? Regardless of how you‚Äôd answer these questions, at the least they highlight how deeply our culture has come to revere objectives.",
"These stories of delayed revelations and serendipitous discovery expose the danger of objectives: If your objective was to invent a microwave oven, you would not be working on radars. If you wanted to build a flying machine (as countless failed inventors did over the years), you wouldn‚Äôt spend the next few decades instead trying to invent an engine. If you were like Charles Babbage in the 1820s [5] and wanted to build a computer, you wouldn‚Äôt dedicate the rest of your life to refining vacuum tube technology.

"The joke is that it takes twenty years to make an overnight success. In business, it‚Äôs more like six to ten. It always takes longer than you think to find product/market fit, to get your customers‚Äô attention, to build a complete solution, and then to make money. You typically need to create at least three generations of any new, disruptive product before you get it right and turn a profit. This is true for B2B and B2C, for companies that build with atoms or electrons or both, for brand-new startups and brand-new products. Keep in mind there are three stages of profitability: 1. Not remotely profitable: With the first version of a product you‚Äôre still testing out the market, testing out the product, trying to find your customers.

"So spend some time developing as great a press release as you can. Consult with marketing and PR people if you have to. They‚Äôll help you trim it down to the essentials.

If you launched right now, could you more or less send that press release into the world and have it be mostly true? If the answer is yes, then congratulations: your product is probably ready, or at least pretty close. You have achieved the core of your vision.

"Every project needs a heartbeat. Pre-V1 launch, that heartbeat is entirely internal. You‚Äôre not talking to the outside world yet, so you have to have a strong internal rhythm that pushes you toward a set launch date.

[See also: Figure 3.1.1, in Chapter 3.1.] So you ignore the million little details that aren‚Äôt as exciting to build‚Äîespecially for V1‚Äîand end up with a neat little demo that doesn‚Äôt actually fit into anyone‚Äôs life. Conversely, you start with a disruptive vision but set it aside because the technology is too difficult or too costly or doesn‚Äôt work well enough. So you execute beautifully on everything else but the one thing that would have differentiated your product withers away. Or you change too many things too fast and regular people can‚Äôt recognize or understand what you‚Äôve made. That‚Äôs one of the (many) issues that befell Google Glass. The look, the technology‚Äîit was all so new that people had no idea what to do with it. There was no",
"When you‚Äôre building the second version of your product, you can talk to actual customers and understand exactly what they think and what they want to see next. You can do all the stuff you desperately wanted to put into V1 but couldn‚Äôt. You can analyze the numbers, understand the costs and benefits. You can confirm your insights with information, A/B tests, charts, and figures. You can adjust and adapt to your customer‚Äôs needs and more and more decisions can be driven by glorious, simple, clear-cut, black-and-white data.",
"If you wait for your product to be perfect, you will never finish. But it‚Äôs very hard to know when you‚Äôre done‚Äîwhen you need to stop building and just put it out into the world. When is it good enough? When are you close enough to your vision? When are the inevitable issues ignorable enough that you can live with them? Typically your vision is so much greater than what materializes in V1. There‚Äôs always another revision, always something else you want to do, change, add, tweak. When do you tear yourself away from what you‚Äôre making and just ‚Ä¶ stop? Ship it. Set it free. See what happens. Here‚Äôs the trick: write a press release.",
"was only with the third version that we understood all the pieces well enough to create the right V1 device. But we would have never reached that third design if we hadn‚Äôt given ourselves hard deadlines with the first two‚Äîif we hadn‚Äôt cut ourselves off after a few months, reset, and moved on. We forced as many constraints on ourselves as possible: not too much time, not too much money, and not too many people on the team. That last point is important.",
"Now the second- and third-generation scooter and bike companies are emerging, but they‚Äôre taking a completely different approach after watching their predecessors flame out. They‚Äôre extremely selective about their markets and are choosing the right atoms‚Äîincredibly durable bikes and scooters. They‚Äôre being wary about where they spend their money and making sure they understand the unit economics in excruciating detail. Having that kind of laser focus on a few key differentiating elements is a much likelier way to reach your goals than throwing out a wide net and hoping for the best.",
"The only way to know is to see if it will chase you. And the chasing process is always the same: First, you‚Äôre dumbstruck by how great an idea this is. How has nobody thought of this before?

"The initial hypothesis‚Äîthat we could repurpose the iPod‚Äôs iconic design and hardware‚Äîproved incorrect. So we hit reset. New hypothesis. This time we would start from scratch, so we gave ourselves five months. The second concept had the basic shape and industrial design of an iPod Mini but with a full face screen and no click wheel‚Äîvery similar to what we see today. We ran into a slew of new problems with that second iPhone prototype design‚Äîwe couldn‚Äôt get the engineering right. The antennas, the GPS, the cameras, the thermals. We‚Äôd never built a mobile phone before, let alone a smartphone, and our assumptions were flawed. Again. Reset. Start over.",
"We needed internal milestones within the project‚Äîregular check-ins where we would make sure everybody understood how the product had evolved and could evolve their side of the business along with it. And to make sure the product still made sense. To see if marketing still liked it. To see if sales still liked it. To see if support could still explain it. To make sure everyone knew what they were making and the plan to launch it. Those milestones slow you down in the short term, but ultimately speed up all of product development. And they make for a better product.",
"You should always be striving to tell a story so good that it stops being yours‚Äîso your customer learns it, loves it, internalizes it, owns it. And tells it to everyone they know.",
"Don‚Äôt go crazy hiring people just because you can. With most projects in the concepting stage, you can get a huge amount done with around ten people or even fewer. You don‚Äôt want to staff up and then be forced to design by committee or put a ton of people on the sidelines, sitting on their hands, waiting for you to figure it out.",
"But you also can‚Äôt slow down too much. The heartbeats of companies that work with atoms rather than electrons are often way too slow. Because atoms are scary: you can‚Äôt relaunch an atom. The right process and timing is a balancing act‚Äînot too fast, not too slow. So look at the year ahead. After you‚Äôve launched your V1, then two to four times in that year, you should be announcing something to the world. New products, new features, new redesigns or updates. Something meaty that‚Äôs worth people‚Äôs attention. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre a big or tiny company; if you‚Äôre building hardware or apps, B2B or B2C, this is the right rhythm for customers. For humans. Any more announcements or big changes and you‚Äôll start confusing people, any fewer and they‚Äôll start forgetting about you. So have at least one really big launch and another one to three smaller launches every year.",
"There will be no break unless you force yourself to take one. So do all the stuff they tell you to do before bed: no caffeine, no sugar, keep it cold, keep it dark, and for the love of all that‚Äôs holy, keep your phone away from your bed. You‚Äôre an addict. We all are. So don‚Äôt make it too easy for yourself‚Äîcharge your phone in another room. Don‚Äôt be the alcoholic with a whiskey bottle in their nightstand (I wish I could say I do this every day, but hey‚ÄîI‚Äôm human, too).",
"No matter what you‚Äôre building, reaching profitability will take longer than you think. You will almost certainly not make any money with V1. You‚Äôll need to reinvent yourself at least three times. Sometimes many more. And even if your timeline has shrunk‚Äîeven if you‚Äôre just revving an app‚Äîyour product still has to learn how to crawl, and then walk, before it can run. That can take just as long for an app or service as it does for a hardware launch. It takes time to evolve and change, to react to customer feedback, to make every point on the customer journey as strong as the product itself. And customers still need time to learn about you, to try your product, to decide it‚Äôs worth it. They need time to march up the adoption curve. The iPod took three generations‚Äîand three years‚Äîbefore it reached profitable unit economics. Same story with the iPhone. The first version was really only for early adopters‚Äîit didn‚Äôt have 3G, didn‚Äôt have the app store, and our pricing model was all wrong. Ste",

We were spending all our time scheduling, arguing over what could and couldn‚Äôt be done in a half day, and it was impossible to see the whole forest through the half trees.",
"The reason unprofitable companies are still around is that they have a giant pool of VC funding or were acquired by even larger tech companies. They focused on finding product/market fit and building their user base first, and figured they‚Äôd iterate on the business model to make money later. But that does not work for everyone. It relies on a swift dive across the chasm and then a long, meandering doggy paddle to profitability through a huge pool of capital. That can doom a company just as fatally as falling into the chasm on the first step.",
"After a few months, we scrapped the whole system. No more half days. We organized our time into bigger chunks‚Äîweeks, months. We started taking a macro view of our projects. And that enabled us to build the V1 of Velo in about eighteen months. Then we handed it, gleaming and new, to sales and marketing. And they had absolutely no idea what to do with it. They‚Äôd never seen it before. They didn‚Äôt know how to sell it, where to sell it, how to advertise it. They had been an afterthought to us, and now we were an afterthought to them.",
"Every Sunday evening, I would go through my notes, reassess and reprioritize all my tasks, rifle through the good ideas, then update those papers on a computer and print out a new version for the week.

"In the early days, Tesla was so focused on the car itself‚Äîand really only several parts of the car‚Äîthat almost nothing else mattered. They had basically no customer support‚Äîthere was nobody you could talk to on the phone. So if your Tesla had an issue, they‚Äôd just come to your house and drive it away. You‚Äôd be left without a car, wondering what you were supposed to do next. Luckily Silicon Valley, Tesla‚Äôs home base, is filled with many tech enthusiasts and early adopters. A friend of mine bought one of the earliest Tesla Roadsters‚Äîtheir V1. It was really an electrified Lotus, hadn‚Äôt been fully redesigned from the ground up, but it had one of Tesla‚Äôs core features: regenerative brakes. Every time you hit the brakes, your car would use the motor as a generator to charge up the battery. The trouble was my friend lived on a mountaintop. So he‚Äôd drive up the mountain and plug in his car for the night, but when he drove back down in the morning, his brakes barely worked. Turned out he couldn",

But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?‚Äù42",
"Nobody is safe from being made into a scapegoat. During a mimetic crisis, perception is distorted. In Freshmanistan, where differences are minor, even the smallest differences are amplified. People project their worst fears onto a scapegoat rather than face the crisis head-on. Nobody wants to pay the price. Saving",
"The salient feature of any ideology is the violence that it both covers up and constrains. In other words, an ideology keeps a group ‚Äúsafe‚Äù from intruders who might bring with them an infectious strain of thought. There is no room for opposition.

"Every once in a while, then, it‚Äôs good to deconstruct the mimetic layers behind someone‚Äôs authority and think seriously about how we chose our sources of knowledge in the first place. We might find that the road to our favorite experts was paved with mimetic influence.",
"One approach I recommend for uncovering thick desires‚Äîthe one I‚Äôll focus on here‚Äîinvolves taking the time to listen to the most deeply fulfilling experiences of your colleagues‚Äô (or partners‚Äô, or friends‚Äô, or classmates‚Äô) lives, and sharing your own with them.",

"If you understand the systems of desire that color the choices of people around you, you‚Äôre more likely to see emergent possibilities by daring to look in different directions. Make visible what is invisible. Mark the boundaries of your current world of wanting, and you‚Äôll gain the ability‚Äîat least the possibility‚Äîto transcend",
"The alternative is the transformation of desire. The engineering approach is like extractive industrial farming, which uses pesticides and tills the land with large machinery, then measures success by seasonal yield, shelf life, and uniformity. The transformation approach is like regenerative farming, which can transform a barren piece of land into rich soil according to the laws and dynamics of the ecosystem. In our case, the ecosystem is one of human ecology‚Äîand desire is its lifeblood.",
The loss of our belief in the scapegoat‚Äôs guilt led to its impotency. Scapegoats are like the gods in Neil Gaiman‚Äôs American Gods‚Äîthey only exist so long as people believe in them.,
"‚ÄúDesire is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want,‚Äù he said.36 Ravikant is drawing on the perennial understanding of numerous spiritual traditions about the link between desire and suffering: desire is always for something we feel we lack, and it causes us to suffer.",
"rivalry is a function of proximity. When people are separated from us by enough time, space, money, or status, there is no way to compete seriously with them for the same opportunities. We don‚Äôt view models in Celebristan as threatening because they probably don‚Äôt care enough about us to adopt our desires as their own.",
"Facebook was built around identity‚Äîthat is to say, desires. It helps people see what other people have and want. It is a platform for finding, following, and differentiating oneself from models. Models of desire are what make Facebook such a potent drug. Before Facebook, a person‚Äôs models came from a small set of people: friends, family, work, magazines, and maybe TV. After Facebook, everyone in the world is a potential model.",

"When happiness becomes the dominant desire in a community in which nobody knows what happiness is or how to achieve it, everyone looks to their right and their left to find models of desire that seem worthy of following. And since everybody in Freshmanistan is in close proximity and on a level playing field, it leads to a conflict of all against all.",
"In a mimetic rivalry, a person‚Äôs rival is like Zeus or the matador. The rival determines what a person wants next, which goals they pursue, what they think about when they go to bed at night. If a person doesn‚Äôt realize what‚Äôs happening, the game will bring them to the point of exhaustion, and maybe worse. Ferrari gave Lamborghini the desire to make supercars.",
"The first stone thrower shows the way. The second reinforces the desire. Now the third person in the crowd is hit with the mimetic force of two mimetic models. They cast the third stone and become the third model. The fourth, fifth, and sixth stones are cast with relative ease compared to the first three. The seventh is effortless. Mimetic contagion has taken",
"Fulfillment Stories ask, ‚ÄúBut why did that action mean so much to you?‚Äù The question and answer kick off a positive mimetic cycle. You tell one of your Fulfillment Stories. I listen with empathy to what you are telling me and reflect back to you what I heard and saw and felt in your story. Then you do the same for me. Empathy imitates empathy,",
"Meditative thought is simply slow, nonproductive thought. It‚Äôs not reactionary. It‚Äôs the kind of thought that, upon hearing news or experiencing something surprising, doesn‚Äôt immediately look for solutions. Instead, it asks a series of questions that help the asker sink down further into the reality: What is this new situation? What is behind it? Meditative thought is patient enough to allow the truth to reveal itself.",

"The word ‚Äúdiscernment,‚Äù on the other hand, comes from the Latin root discernere, which means ‚Äúto distinguish‚Äù; it refers to the ability to see the difference between two paths and to know which one is the better way forward. Discernment is an essential skill because it‚Äôs a process for making decisions that includes but also transcends rational analysis. It‚Äôs critical for deciding which desires to pursue and which ones to leave behind.",
Girard believed that all true desire‚Äîthe post-instinctual kind‚Äîis metaphysical. People are always in search of something that goes beyond the material world.,

"People don‚Äôt only model the desire for third parties or objects; they can also model the desire for themselves. Playing hard to get is a tried-and-true method to drive people crazy, but few ever ask why. Mimetic desire provides a clue. We are fascinated with models because they show us something worth wanting that is just beyond our reach‚Äîincluding their affection.",
"We‚Äôre model addicts. Right now, the models we prefer are experts. That could be because we think of ourselves as more rational than ever‚Äîand we are, in many ways. Scientific progress has been swift in the past hundred years. However, we underestimate the strong role that mimesis plays in the way we choose our experts.",
"The pride that makes a person believe they are unaffected by or inoculated against biases, weaknesses, or mimesis blinds them to their complicity in the game.",
"As Peter Thiel points out in Zero to One, Karl Marx and William Shakespeare had very different views about why people fight. Marx thought conflict happens because people are different. People fight because they have different goals, desires, and ideas due to differences in the material goods they possess. In this framework, we would expect people who have the same material goods to fight less. Shakespeare‚Äôs view seems to be exactly the opposite: people fight when they are similar, like the Capulets and Montagues in Romeo and Juliet.",
"People worry about what other people will think before they say something‚Äîwhich affects what they say. In other words, our perception of reality changes reality by altering the way we might otherwise act. This leads to a self-fulfilling circularity.",
"Jesus came upon a woman who had been caught in the act of adultery and who was about to be stoned by an angry mob. He intervened, saying, ‚ÄúLet anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.‚Äù The words threw everything off balance. The cycle of destructive violence was knocked off its course. One by one, the men standing around the woman began dropping their stones and walking away. First one, then another, then the pace accelerated.",
"A hierarchy of values is an antidote to mimetic conformity. If all values are treated as equal, then the one that wins out‚Äîespecially at a time of crisis‚Äîis the one that is most mimetic. (During the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, there was panic-buying of toilet paper. There was no issue with supply; there was an issue with mimesis. Cultural values are often subject to the same irrationality‚Äîpeople tend to panic-buy whatever is most important to them at the moment rather than what is best for the common good.) It‚Äôs not enough to name values. They need to be ranked. When all values are the same, nothing is being valued at all. It‚Äôs like highlighting every single word in a book.",
"They protect themselves from what they want‚Äîfrom their mimetic desires, which have brought them into conflict with one another‚Äîby directing their desire to vanquish their rivals to a single fixed point: someone that has become a proxy for all of their enemies. Someone who is unable to fight back. A scapegoat.",
"If the modern world seems to be going crazy, it‚Äôs partly because we are hyperaware of the ways in which exploitation and violence against innocent victims occur, but we simply don‚Äôt know what to do about them. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôve been told something terrible that we didn‚Äôt want to know, and which we‚Äôre powerless to fix entirely on our own. And that‚Äôs a recipe for collective madness.",
"The ultimate way to test desires‚Äîespecially major life choices such as whether to marry someone or whether to quit your job and start a company‚Äîis to practice this same exercise but to do it while imagining yourself on your deathbed. Which choice leaves you more consoled? Which choice causes you more agitation? Steve Jobs, in his 2005 commencement speech at Stanford, noted, ‚ÄúDeath is very likely the single best invention of life. It is life‚Äôs change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.‚Äù The deathbed is where unfulfilling desires are exposed. Transport yourself there now rather than waiting until later, when it might be too late.",
Scapegoats are often insiders who are perceived to violate the group‚Äôs orthodoxy or taboos. Their behavior makes them appear as a threat to the group‚Äôs unity. They come to be seen as cancers or monstrous outsiders who have violated or destroyed the social bonds that hold the group together. Eliminating the scapegoat is the act through which the group becomes unified again.,
"Thick desires are like diamonds that have been formed deep beneath the surface, nearer to the core of the Earth. Thick desires are protected from the volatility of changing circumstances in our lives. Thin desires, on the other hand, are highly mimetic, contagious, and often shallow.",

"The tactic Jesus used to prevent the stoning was depriving the crowd of a violent model and replacing it with a nonviolent model. Instead of a violent contagion taking hold, a nonviolent contagion happened instead. The first person dropped their stone. Then, one by one, the rest followed. Cycle 1, mimetic violence, was transformed into Cycle 2, a positive mimetic process. Both depended on a model.",
"Girard thought we had entered a dangerous new phase of history, ripe for what von Clausewitz called ‚Äúthe escalation to extremes‚Äù‚Äîthe desire of each side in a conflict to destroy the other, which reinforces and escalates the desire of the other for violence.",
"The scapegoat mechanism, he found, turns a war of all against all into a war of all against one. It brings temporary peace as people forget their mimetic conflicts for a while, having just discharged all of their anger onto a scapegoat.",

The VC demand for quick-hitting investments increases the attractiveness of tech start-ups to entrepreneurs. A mimetic system takes shape. It is driven not only by economic incentives and financial returns‚Äîwhich no doubt factor in‚Äîbut also the prestige and validation that come with being financed by the right VC. They award Michelin stars in the form of investment checks. And for VCs: the benefits of having invested in sexy companies and headline-grabbing CEOs.,
"There are two approaches that people commonly take to escape from Cycle 1.

"Many books have been written about improving one‚Äôs ability to discern well. Here is a distillation of some key points: (1) pay attention to the interior movements of the heart when contemplating different desires‚Äîwhich give a fleeting feeling of satisfaction and which give satisfaction that endures? (2) ask yourself which desire is more generous and loving; (3) put yourself on your deathbed in your mind‚Äôs eye and ask yourself which desire you would be more at peace with having followed; (4) finally, and most importantly, ask yourself where a given desire comes from.",
"When desires converge on the same object, conflict is inevitable. The real danger of AI is not robots that might one day be smarter than us but that might want the same things that we want: our job, our spouse, our dreams. Engineering desires in robots or in humans raises serious questions about humanity‚Äôs future. Historian Yuval Noah Harari ends his book Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind with these words: ‚ÄúBut since we might soon be able to engineer our desires, too, the real question facing us is not ‚ÄòWhat do we want to become?,‚Äô but ‚ÄòWhat do we want to want?‚Äô Those who are not spooked by this question probably haven‚Äôt given it enough thought.‚Äù",
"How fast does truth travel from Point A (the origin) to Point B (the person who most needs to know it) and ultimately to everyone? For instance, if an outside salesperson learns critical information about a competitor, how quickly does that information make it to the CEO or key decision-maker who can do something about it?",
"‚ÄúThe last major innovation in K-12 education was Montessori,‚Äù wrote VC Marc Andreessen.8 Her innovation was not just a methodology or curriculum; she reimagined education from the perspective of desire. She unshackled the children‚Äôs imagination and allowed them to learn according to their natural curiosity and wonder. She allowed thick desires to form in them‚Äînot least of all, a thick desire for learning‚Äîby not quenching the flames of desire before they could spread and grow in intensity. (For instance, she didn‚Äôt move them in a regimented way from bell to bell, from one activity to the next, along strictly defined, soul-crushing, subject-matter lines.)",
"Catriona Kelly and Vadim Volkov have pointed out in their essay ‚ÄúDirected Desires: Kul‚Äôturnost‚Äô and Consumption‚Äù that the transition to Soviet Russia came about through what they call directed desires. There was a subtle campaign to direct people to want certain things and reject others. The idea of kulturnost, or culturedness in English, began to emerge. It was a right way to live based on shared Russian cultural values.",
"In my experience, the most effective context for discerning desires is a silent retreat‚Äîideally, at least five days (but a minimum of three) of being unplugged from all noise and screens, in a remote location, completely off the grid. No talking allowed.",
"Empathy is the ability to share in another person‚Äôs experience‚Äîbut without imitating them (their speech, their beliefs, their actions, their feelings) and without identifying with them to the point that one‚Äôs own individuality and self-possession are lost. In this sense, empathy is anti-mimetic.",
"Simplifying also helps storytellers tell their stories better. When time and space is limited, it‚Äôs easier to remember your story. Easier to master your transitions, and easier to remember those favorite lines that you don‚Äôt want to forget. But simplification is even more important because of the difference between oral storytelling and written storytelling.",
"Second, starting your story with a thesis statement reduces your chances of surprising your audience. When you tell me that the story is hilarious, I‚Äôm already primed for humor. When you say, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to believe this,‚Äù I am prepared for the improbable. Surprise is a beautiful thing in a story. Apart from vulnerability, it may be the most beautiful thing about stories. Letting your audience know that your story is hilarious or improbable hinders your ability to catch them off-guard and offer them a surprise later on.",
"Start with the story, not with a summary of the story. There is no need to describe the tone or tenor at the onset. Just start with story, and whenever possible, open with movement.

"Hourglasses There comes a time in many stories when you reached a moment (or the moment) that the audience has been waiting for. Perhaps you have paved the way to the moment with Breadcrumbs and Backpacks, or maybe you‚Äôve used none of these strategies because you‚Äôve got yourself a stake-laden story, and now you‚Äôre approaching the payoff. The sentence you‚Äôve been waiting to say. The sentence your audience has been waiting to hear. This is the moment to use an Hourglass. It‚Äôs time to slow things down. Grind them to a halt when possible. When you know the audience is hanging on your every word, let them hang. Drag out the wait as long as possible.",
The trick is to choose the Breadcrumbs that create the most wonder in the minds of your audience without giving them enough to guess correctly. Choose wisely. Breadcrumbs are particularly effective when the truly unexpected is coming. I am about to impersonate a charity worker in order to steal money from innocent homeowners. That is unexpected. The perfect moment to lay a Breadcrumb.,

"Backpacks are most effective when a plan does not work. If I had described my plan for begging for gas, and then the plan worked perfectly, there would have been no payoff for the Backpack. The scene would fall flat. If I go through all the trouble of explaining my plan beforehand, and then I say, ‚ÄúThe kid agrees to lend me the gas,‚Äù the audience is oddly unsatisfied. They are left wondering why I went through all of that explanation only to find out that things turned out fine.",
"In addition to adding in superfluous detail and summary, I‚Äôll slow my pace as I approach this sentence. I will reduce my volume. I want the audience on the edge of their seats, desperately awaiting those twelve words. It‚Äôs the perfect time to use an Hourglass. Stakes.

"So dig. Search. Hunt. Fight for the five-second moment. Allow yourself to recall the entire event. Don‚Äôt get hung up on the big moments, the unbelievable circumstances, or the hilarious details. Seek out the moments when you felt your heart move. When something changed forever, even if that moment seems minuscule compared to the rest of the story. That will be your five-second moment. Until you have it, you don‚Äôt have a story. When you find it, you‚Äôre ready to begin crafting your story.",
"All great stories ‚Äî regardless of length or depth or tone ‚Äî tell the story of a five-second moment in a person‚Äôs life. Got that? Let me say it again: Every great story ever told is essentially about a five-second moment in the life of a human being, and the purpose of the story is to bring that moment to the greatest clarity possible.",
"Backpacks A Backpack is a strategy that increases the stakes of the story by increasing the audience‚Äôs anticipation about a coming event. It‚Äôs when a storyteller loads up the audience with all the storyteller‚Äôs hopes and fears in that moment before moving the story forward. It‚Äôs an attempt to do two things: ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†¬†Make the audience wonder what will happen next. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†¬†Make your audience experience the same emotion, or something like the same emotion, that the storyteller experienced in the moment about to be described.",
"They want to know. They need to know. So what do I do? I stop the story cold. I bring everything to a halt. I start by describing things that don‚Äôt require a description.

"Crystal Balls The Crystal Ball is the easiest of the strategies to deploy, because you already use Crystal Balls in everyday life. A Crystal Ball is a false prediction made by a storyteller to cause the audience to wonder if the prediction will prove to be true.

He‚Äôs calling the police, and they will come and arrest me for stealing money from McDonald‚Äôs. This does not happen, of course, but when I present this very real possibility, the audience wants to know if it will happen.

These five-second moments are the moments in your life when something fundamentally changes forever. You fall in love. You fall out of love. You discover something new about yourself or another person. Your opinion on a subject dramatically changes. You find forgiveness. You reach acceptance. You sink into despair. You grudgingly resign. You‚Äôre drowned in regret. You make a life-altering decision. Choose a new path. Accomplish something great. Fail spectacularly. These are the moments that make great stories.,
"The Elephant tells the audience what to expect. It gives them a reason to listen, a reason to wonder. It infuses the story with instantaneous stakes.

"We start at the end. This is a beautiful thing, because knowing the ending will inform all the choices that we must make as we craft the rest of the story. Everything must serve our five-second moment, so knowing the ending ‚Äî and starting the process of crafting the story with the ending ‚Äî is helpful beyond measure. In fact the ending simply involves the choice of words you will use. How will you describe your five-second moment for the greatest emotional effect? The",
"Third, these are simply not interesting ways to start a story. A thesis statement, a prediction about the audience‚Äôs response to the story, or a summary of its theme or mood does not immediately draw us into the story‚Äôs time and place.

"Once you‚Äôve distilled your five-second moment down to its essence, ask yourself: What is the opposite of your five-second moment? Simply put, the beginning of the story should be the opposite of the end. Find the opposite of your transformation, revelation, or realization, and this is where your story should start. This is what creates an arc in your story. This is how a story shows change over time.",

They want to see their characters ultimately triumph, but they want suffering first. They don‚Äôt want anything to be easy.",
"Essentially Crash & Burn is stream-of-consciousness writing. I like to think of it as dreaming on the end of your pen, because when it‚Äôs working well, it will mimic the free-associative thought patterns that so many of us experience while dreaming.",
"Rule #1: You must not get attached to any one idea. The goal of Crash & Burn is to allow unexpected ideas to intersect and overrun current ones, just as that rain-drenched corner of Main Street with my dog produced an important revelation about my father and a memory of sex on a golf course. Two intersecting ideas crashed into and overran the meaningful moment that I was experiencing with Kaleigh.",
"I present the audience with one Elephant, but then I paint it another color. I trick them. This is an excellent storytelling strategy: make your audience think they are on one path, and then when they least expect it, show them that they have been on a different path all along.",
"If only every beginning were this easy to find. More often, the beginning is much harder to find because the opposite of your five-second moment does not happen on the same day or even in the same week as any possible beginning.",
"Your story must reflect change over time. A story cannot simply be a series of remarkable events. You must start out as one version of yourself and end as something new. The change can be infinitesimal. It need not reflect an improvement in yourself or your character, but change must happen. Even the worst movies in the world reflect some change in a character over time.",

"The Elephant Every story must have an Elephant. The Elephant is the thing that everyone in the room can see. It is large and obvious. It is a clear statement of the need, the want, the problem, the peril, or the mystery. It signifies where the story is headed, and it makes it clear to your audience that this is in fact a story and not a simple musing on a subject.",
"As I reflected on each day of my life and identified the most storyworthy moments, I began to develop a storytelling lens ‚Äî one that is now sharp and clear. With this lens, I began to see that my life is filled with stories. Moments of real meaning that I had never noticed before were suddenly staring me in the face. You won‚Äôt believe how plentiful they are.",
"To do this work, I decided to use an Excel spreadsheet. It works well for several reasons. First, it forced me to capture these moments in just a few words. As you can see, my spreadsheet is broken into two columns: the date and the story. That‚Äôs it. As a result, I don‚Äôt allow myself to write more than the story cell allows. For a novelist who is accustomed to writing hundreds and sometimes thousands of words per day, the temptation to write more was great, but I believe in simplicity. I believe in strategies that are easy to apply and maintain even on our busiest days. This is the best way to develop a habit.",
"I also allowed myself to record any meaningful memories that came to mind over the course of the day, in response either to something I added to the spreadsheet or something that came to mind organically. Oftentimes these were recovered memories: moments from my past that had been forgotten for years but had returned to my mind through the process of doing Homework for Life.",
This is why tiny moments like the one at my dining-room table with my wife and children often make the best stories. These are the moments that connect with people. These are the stories that touch people‚Äôs hearts.,

"As you work together to co-create a shared experience map, focus on synthesizing your work together rather than choosing the ‚Äúbest‚Äù drawing to move forward with. Start by turning each of your individual maps into a collection of nodes and links. A node is a distinct moment in time, an action, or an event, while links are what connect nodes together. For example, my map of how customers entertain themselves might include the following nodes: hearing about a new show, discussing it with their significant other, a searching or browsing moment, the error case of not being able to find the content, the time spent being entertained, and the end of the entertainment session. Links help show relationships between the nodes. For example, I might loop back several times in this process. Perhaps I choose Netflix but can‚Äôt find anything to watch, so I switch to YouTube. Links can show the movement through the nodes.",
"Collapse similar nodes together. Many of your individual maps will include overlapping nodes. Feel free to collapse similar nodes together. However, be careful. Make sure you are collapsing like items and not generalizing so much that you lose key detail. Determine the links between each node. Use arrows to show the flow through the nodes. Don‚Äôt just map out the happy path. Remember to capture where steps need to be redone, where people might give up out of frustration, or where steps might loop back on themselves. Add context.

"Conversational norms set the expectation for a 50/50 back-and-forth pattern when two people are conversing. This means that each person spends roughly 50% of the time talking. I say something, and then you say something. If I ask you a short question, you are likely to respond with a short answer. As the interviewer, you need to reset this expectation. One of the most effective ways to do this is to inform your participant that you would like them to share their full story with you, to share as many details as possible, to leave nothing out, and that, when they are done with their story, you‚Äôll ask for missing details.",

When you choose a target opportunity, you are choosing how to spend your next few days or weeks. You are not committing to addressing that opportunity. You are simply committing to exploring it further with your discovery work.

"We need each opportunity to be distinct from every other opportunity. If there‚Äôs overlap, then we can‚Äôt work on one at a time.

"We started by defining a clear desired outcome, we interviewed to discover opportunities, we visually captured and synthesized what we were learning with experience maps and opportunity solution trees, we prioritized a target opportunity, we brainstormed solutions, we identified our hidden assumptions, we rapidly tested those assumptions, and we continued to measure impact all the way through delivery.",
"Share the set of three solutions you plan to move forward with. Ask them if they would have chosen a different set. Stay open-minded. You may have invested time and energy into your solution set, but remember: Solution ideas are a dime a dozen. The key criteria for your first solution set is diversity. Your stakeholders can often help you generate more diverse ideas than what your team can do on their own. If that‚Äôs the case, don‚Äôt be afraid to swap in some of their ideas.",

"To be clear, it‚Äôs not that exercise makes you eat better or making your bed makes you more disciplined, but doing the former makes the latter easier. The keystone habit builds motivation for the subsequent habits. I‚Äôve noticed this exact pattern emerge among product teams who develop a weekly habit of customer interviews. When product teams engage with their customers week over week, they don‚Äôt just get the benefit of interviewing more often‚Äîthey also start rapid prototyping and experimenting more often. They remember to doubt what they know and to test their assumptions.

"This didn‚Äôt happen overnight. I was 22. I had no idea what I was doing. I simply had a guiding principle: If I‚Äôm going to do good design work, I need to get close to my customer. That guiding principle stayed with me as I went on to work at early-stage startups; it‚Äôs guided me as I started my own business, and it‚Äôs helped me develop the coaching curriculum that this book is based on.",
"‚ÄúConfidence is a feeling, which reflects the coherence of the information and the cognitive ease of processing it.‚Äù Not necessarily the truth.",
"After some reflection7, I realized there‚Äôs an underlying structure to discovery that we can use to guide our work. It starts with defining a clear outcome‚Äîone that sets the scope for discovery. From there, we must discover and map out the opportunity space‚Äî",
"The root of the tree is your desired outcome‚Äîthe business need that reflects how your team can create business value. Next is the opportunity space. These are the customer needs, pain points, and desires that, if addressed, will drive your desired outcome. Below the opportunity space is the solution space. This is where we‚Äôll visually depict the solutions we are exploring. Below the solution space are assumption tests. This is how we‚Äôll evaluate which solutions will help us best create customer value in a way that drives business value.",
"to summarize what you are learning in a way that is easy to understand, that highlights your key decision points and the options that you considered,",
"When we learn through testing that an idea won‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs not enough to move on to the next idea. We need to take time to reflect. We want to ask: ‚ÄúBased on my current understanding of my customer, I thought this solution would work. It didn‚Äôt. What did I misunderstand about my customer?‚Äù We then need to revise our understanding of the opportunity space before moving on to new solutions.10",
Product trios should interview together.,
"Common goal-setting advice encourages us to set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (S.M.A.R.T.) goals. The research on goal setting, however, muddies the waters.",
"you thought), you‚Äôll simply turn around and choose another target opportunity.",
"Instead, for each opportunity, ask the following questions: Is this opportunity framed as a customer need, pain point, or desire and not a solution? Is this opportunity unique to this customer, or have we seen it in more than one interview? If we address this opportunity, will it drive our desired outcome?",
S.M.A.R.T. goals play a role and are common for trios that have experience with their product outcomes. But it‚Äôs not one-size-fits-all. It‚Äôs perfectly fine to start with a learning goal and work your way toward a S.M.A.R.T. performance goal.,
"Instead of managing an opportunity backlog, we‚Äôll use an opportunity solution tree (introduced in Chapter 2) to help us map out and understand the opportunity space. The tree structure will help us visualize and understand the complexity of the opportunity space. Trees depict two key relationships‚Äîparent-child relationships and sibling relationships. Both will help us make sense of the messy opportunity space. The parent-child relationship will be used to represent subsets‚Äîa child opportunity (or sub-opportunity) is a subset of a parent opportunity. For example, in the previous section, we saw that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm out of episodes of my favorite show‚Äù was one reason‚Äîbut not the only reason‚Äîfor ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find anything to watch.‚Äù Referring to the tree relationships, we would say that ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find anything to watch‚Äù is the parent of the child ‚ÄúI‚Äôm out of episodes of my favorite shows.‚Äù We might then ask, ‚ÄúWhat are some other reasons our customers say, ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt find anything to watch‚Äô?‚Äù",
"It sounds simple, but this structure helps us know what to do when. I encourage teams to visualize it using an opportunity solution tree (OST).",
"While many teams work top-down, starting by defining a clear desired outcome, then mapping out the opportunity space, then considering solutions, and finally running assumption tests to evaluate those solutions, the best teams also work bottom-up. They use their assumption tests to help them evaluate their solutions and evolve the opportunity space.",
"In Decisive, the Heath brothers outline many tactics for overcoming the four villains of decision-making, which is why it is the first book (after this one)",
"product leader should not be dictating solutions. Instead, the leader should be identifying an appropriate product outcome for the trio to focus on. Outcomes are a good way for the leader to communicate strategic intent. For example, if Sonja‚Äôs team is focused on increasing the number of dogs",
"Only once appropriate strategies were identified did performance increase with a specific, challenging performance goal.18",
"Managing by outcomes is only as effective as the outcomes themselves. If we choose the wrong outcomes, we‚Äôll still get the wrong results. When considering outcomes for specific teams, it helps to distinguish between business outcomes, product outcomes, and traction metrics. A business outcome measures how well the business is progressing. A product outcome measures how well the product is moving the business forward. A traction metric measures usage of a specific feature or workflow in the product. Business",
The photo and the memorable quote will act as keys that help you to unlock your memory of the stories you heard. The quick facts help you situate those stories in the right context. Now you want to capture the heart of what you learned. You‚Äôll do this by identifying the insights and opportunities that you heard in the interview.,
"The success of pre-mortems, however, hinges on one key factor‚Äîphrasing the question as if the outcome is certain. In our case, that means we have to consider that the product or service did fail, not that it might fail.",
"Customers don‚Äôt always know what they want. Most aren‚Äôt well-versed in technology. Nor do they have time to dream up what‚Äôs possible. That‚Äôs our job. That‚Äôs what Jobs meant when he said, ‚ÄúOur task is to read things that are not yet on the page.‚Äù We are the inventors, not our customers.",
"Chip and Dan Heath, in their book Decisive, outline four villains of decision-making that lead to poor decisions. The first villain is looking too narrowly at a problem. This is exactly why we want to explore multiple ways of framing the opportunity space. The second villain is looking for evidence that confirms our beliefs. This is commonly known as confirmation bias.",
"Setting a team‚Äôs outcome should be a two-way negotiation between the product leader (e.g., Chief Product Officer, Vice President of Product, etc.) and the product trio.",
"If your product trio is already negotiating outcomes with your product leader, congratulations! However, remember to keep these tips in mind as you set outcomes with your leader: Is your team being tasked with a product outcome and not a business outcome or a traction metric? If you are being tasked with a traction metric, is the metric well known? Have you already confirmed that your customers want to exhibit the behavior being tracked? If it‚Äôs the first time you are working on a new metric, are you starting with a learning goal (e.g., discover the relevant opportunities) before committing to a challenging performance goal? If you have experience with the metric, have you set a specific and challenging goal?",
"The purpose of customer interviewing is not to ask your customers what you should build. Instead, the purpose of an interview is to discover and explore opportunities. Remember, opportunities are customer needs, pain points, and desires. They are opportunities to intervene in your customers‚Äô lives in a positive way.",
"Create a new map that includes all of your individual nodes. Arrange the nodes from all of your individual maps into a new, comprehensive map.",
"Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, made this exact argument in his 2015 letter to shareholders,33 where he introduced the idea of Level 1 and Level 2 decisions. He describes a Level 1 decision as one that is hard to reverse, whereas a Level 2 decision is one that is easy to reverse. Bezos argues that we should be slow and cautious when making Level 1 decisions, but that we should move fast and not wait for perfect data when making Level 2 decisions. I prefer the imagery of one-way door and two-way door decisions.",
"Remember, everyone‚Äôs perspective can and should contribute to the team‚Äôs shared understanding. We saw in our opening story that the trio‚Äôs shared map was stronger because they synthesized the unique perspectives on the team into a richer experience map than any of them could have individually created.",
"Our primary research question in any interview should be: What needs, pain points, and desires matter most to this customer?",
"As the participant tells their story, you can encourage them to keep going by asking them, ‚ÄúWhat happened next?‚Äù Sometimes they might skip a few steps, and you may need to ask, ‚ÄúWhat happened before that?‚Äù Thinking about their story as having a beginning, a middle, and an end can help you guide the participant.

"We see some teams solve this by generating multi-page discussion guides. But this strategy assumes that you‚Äôll be talking to customers only occasionally, therefore, you need to ask them everything right now. Instead, assume you‚Äôll talk to customers every week, and focus on what you need to learn at this moment in time.",
"Temporal prompts are one of the most effective ways to guide the participant through their own story. You can ask, ‚ÄúStart at the beginning. What happened first?‚Äù You",
"Let‚Äôs start at the beginning. All product teams do a set of activities to decide what to build and then do a different set of activities to build and deliver it. While you‚Äôll learn that these activities can and should overlap and interweave with each other, the work that is required to do each is fundamentally different. In this book, I‚Äôll refer to the work that you do to decide what to build as discovery and the work that you do to build and ship a product as delivery.",
"When we show our work, we are inviting our stakeholders to co-create with us. Instead of sharing our conclusions and inviting them to share their preferences, we are sharing our work and inviting them to assess our thinking and to add their own. We are leveraging their expertise and improving our process.",
Your stakeholder needs to fully understand the opportunity you are pursuing before you share solutions with them. This is what sets the context for how to evaluate solutions and moves the conversation away from opinions and preferences.,
"If you want to build a successful product, you need to understand your customers‚Äô actual behavior‚Äîtheir reality‚Äînot the story they tell themselves.",

"The value of breaking big opportunities into a series of smaller opportunities is twofold. First, it allows us to tackle problems that otherwise might seem unsolvable. And second, it allows us to deliver value over time. That second benefit is at the heart of the Agile manifesto and is a key tenet of continuous improvement. Rather than waiting until we can solve the bigger problem‚Äî‚ÄúIs this show any good?‚Äù‚Äîwe can deliver value iteratively over time. We might start by solving the smaller problem of ‚ÄúWho is in this show?‚Äù because it‚Äôs fairly easy to solve and because we know a large percentage of our audience chooses shows according to this criterion. This allows us to ship value quickly.",
"You always want to choose a leaf-node opportunity (i.e., one that has no children) because our goal is to deliver iterative value over time. We can do this by solving a series of smaller opportunities in succession rather than addressing sets of opportunities at once. However, this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that your target opportunity will be easy to address. It simply means that you haven‚Äôt (yet) identified any sub-opportunities that contribute to addressing it.",
